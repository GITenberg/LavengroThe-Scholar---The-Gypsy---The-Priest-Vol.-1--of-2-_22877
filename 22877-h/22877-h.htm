<h2><!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>There have been many Romany Ryes, or &ldquo;Gypsy
Gentlemen,&rdquo; as Gypsies designate those who, though not of
their race, yet have loved that race, and have mastered the
Romany tongue.&nbsp; The first is one of the oddest&mdash;Andrew
Boorde (<i>c.</i> 1490-1549).&nbsp; Carthusian, traveller,
physician, and, perhaps, the original Merry Andrew, he got into
trouble over certain delinquencies, and died a prisoner in the
Fleet gaol.&nbsp; In 1542 he was writing his <i>Fyrst Boke of the
Introduction of Knowledge</i>, and had come to &ldquo;the
xxxviii. chapiter,&rdquo; which &ldquo;treateth of Egypt, and of
theyr money and of theyr speche.&rdquo;&nbsp; He started
bravely:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Egipt is a countrey ioyned to Jury,<br />
The countrey is plentyfull of wine, corne and hony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be many great wyldernes, in the which be many
great wylde beastes.&nbsp; In ye which wildernis liuid many holy
fathers, as it apperith in vitas patrum.&nbsp; The
people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here, I fancy, he suddenly broke off; what did he know of
the Egyptian people?&nbsp; Greece <!-- page xiv--><a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>was the
nearest he had ever been to Egypt.&nbsp; Going, however, for a
stroll through his native county of Sussex, he presently lights
on a band of &ldquo;right Egyptians,&rdquo; belike in front of an
alehouse.&nbsp; Egyptians! the very thing!&nbsp; Like any
newspaper correspondent of to-day, he must straightway have
whipped out his notebook, and jotted down the rest of his
chapter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The people of the country be swarte, and
doth go disgisid in theyr apparel, contrary to other
nacions.&nbsp; They be lyght fyngerd and vse pyking, they have
litle maner and euyl loggyng, and yet they be pleasant
daunsers.&nbsp; Ther be few or none of the Egypcions yt doth dwel
in Egipt, for Egipt is repleted now with infydel alyons.&nbsp;
Ther mony is brasse and golde.&nbsp; Yf there be any man yt wyl
learne parte of theyr speche, Englyshe and Egipt speche
foloweth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there duly follows a neat little Ollendorfian dialogue
about meat and bread, wine and beer, and such-like, in which Dr.
Furnivall, Boorde&rsquo;s editor, left it for Professor Zupitza
to recognise excellent Romany.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit you downe and
dryncke,&rdquo; &ldquo;Drinke, drynke for God&rsquo;s
sake,&rdquo; are two of the phrases.&nbsp; The interview was
probably prolonged, perhaps renewed; Andrew Boorde would find
good fellowship with Gypsies.</p>
<p>No. 2 is <i>the</i> Scholar-Gypsy, of whom, alas! we know all
too little, neither name nor dates, but only just what Joseph
Glanvill tells in his <i>Vanity of Dogmatizing</i>
(1661):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was very lately a Lad in the
<i>University</i> of <i>Oxford</i>, <!-- page xv--><a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>who being of
very pregnant and ready parts, and yet wanting the encouragement
of preferment, was by his poverty forc&rsquo;d to leave his
studies there, and to cast himself upon the wide world for a
livelyhood.&nbsp; Now, his necessities growing dayly on him and
wanting the help of friends to relieve him, he was at last forced
to joyn himself to a company of <i>Vagabond Gypsies</i>, whom
occasionly he met with, and to follow their Trade for a
maintenance.&nbsp; Among these extravagant people, by the
insinuating subtilty of his carriage, he quickly got so much of
their love and esteem, as that they discover&rsquo;d to him their
<i>Mystery</i>: in the practice of which, by the pregnancy of his
wit and parts, he soon grew so good and proficient as to be able
to out-do his Instructours.&nbsp; After he had been a pretty
while well exercis&rsquo;d in the Trade, there chanc&rsquo;d to
ride by a couple of <i>Scholars</i> who had formerly bin of his
acquaintance.&nbsp; The <i>Scholars</i> had quickly spyed out
their old friend among the <i>Gypsies</i>, and their amazement to
see him among such society had well-nigh discover&rsquo;d him:
but by a sign he prevented their owning him before that Crew: and
taking one of them aside privately, desired him with his friend
to go to an <i>Inn</i>, not far distant thence, promising there
to come to them.&nbsp; They accordingly went thither, and he
follows: after their first salutations, his friends enquire how
he came to lead so odd a life as that was, and to joyn himself
with such a <i>cheating beggerly</i> company.&nbsp; The
<i>Scholar-Gypsy</i> having given them an account of the
necessity which drove him to that kind of life, told them that
the people he went with were not such <i>Impostouirs</i> as they
were taken for, but that they had a <i>traditional</i> kind of
<i>learning</i> among them, and could do wonders by the power of
<i>Imagination</i>, and that himself had learnt much of their
Art, and improved it further then themselves could.&nbsp; And to
evince the truth of what he told them, he said, he&rsquo;d remove
into another room, leaving them to discourse <!-- page xvi--><a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>together,
and upon his return tell them the sum of what they had talked of:
which accordingly he perform&rsquo;d, giving them a full account
of what had passed between them in his absence.&nbsp; The
<i>Scholars</i> being amaz&rsquo;d at so unexpected a discovery,
earnestly desir&rsquo;d him to unriddle the <i>mystery</i>.&nbsp;
In which he gave them satisfaction, by telling them, that what he
did was by the power of <i>Imagination</i>, his Phancy
<i>binding</i> theirs, and that himself had dictated to them the
discourse they held together, while he was from them: That there
were warrantable wayes of heightening the <i>Imagination</i> to
that pitch as to bind anothers, and that when he had
compass&rsquo;d the whole <i>secret</i>, some parts of which he
said he was yet ignorant of, he intended to leave their company,
and give the world an account of what he had learned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third of our Romany Ryes is a Scottish peer and a
Jacobite, George Seton, fifth Earl of Wintoun (1679-1749).&nbsp;
He as a young man quarrelled with his father, and, taking up with
a band of Gypsies who frequented the Seton property, set off with
them on their wanderings over Scotland, England, and the
Continent.&nbsp; He seems to have been away from June 1700 until
November 1707: and when, by his father&rsquo;s death in 1704, he
succeeded to the earldom, &ldquo;no man knew where to find him,
till accident led to the discovery.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Robert
Patten, the Judas and the historian of the &rsquo;15, records
how, on the rebels&rsquo; march from Kelso to Preston, Lord
Wintoun would tell &ldquo;many pleasant Stories of his Travels
and his living unknown and obscurely with a Blacksmith in France,
whom he served some years as a Bellows-blower <!-- page xvii--><a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>and
Under-Servant.&nbsp; He was,&rdquo; Patten adds, &ldquo;very
curious in working in several Handicraft Matters, and had made
good Proficiency in them, witness the nice way he had found to
cut asunder one of the Iron Bars in his Window in the Tower, by
some small Instrument, scarce perceivable.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was on
4th August 1716 that Lord Wintoun made his escape, but, like
everything else in his life, it is wrapped in obscurity.&nbsp;
For, according to the Diary of Mary Countess Cowper for 19th
March 1716, the last day of his trial, &ldquo;My Lord
<i>Winton</i> had sawed an iron Bar with the Spring of his Watch
very near in two, in order to make his Escape; but it was found
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, possibly, there is something in the story
told by the author of <i>Rab and his Friends</i>, that he was
carried out of the Tower in a hamper, supposed to be full of
family charters, by John Gunn, &ldquo;the head of a band of
roving gipsies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyhow, ever afterwards he lived at
Rome, where in 1737 he was great master of the Lodge of
Freemasonry.&nbsp; He died unmarried, though Lady Cowper alleges
&ldquo;he has eight Wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Bosvile, the scion of a good old Yorkshire house, is
another who must have known much about the Gypsies.&nbsp; He was
buried at Rossington, near Doncaster, on 30th January 1709; and
more than a hundred years later the Gypsies would visit the
churchyard, and pour out a flagon of ale on his grave by the
chancel door.&nbsp; <!-- page xviii--><a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>Joseph
Hunter, the historian of South Yorkshire, tells how he had</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;established a species of sovereignty among
that singular people, the Gypsies, who before the enclosures
frequented the moors round Rossington.&nbsp; His word with them
was law, and his authority so great that he perfectly restrained
the pilfering propensities for which the tribe is censured, and
gained the entire good-will for himself and his subjects of the
farmers and people around.&nbsp; He was a gentleman with an
estate of about 200<i>l.</i> a year; and his contemporary,
Abraham de la Pryme of Hatfield, describes him as &lsquo;a mad
spark, mighty fine and brisk, keeping company with a great many
gentlemen, knights, and esquires, yet running about the
country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bamfylde Moore Carew (1693-? 1770), the son of the rector of
Bickleigh, near Tiverton, is semi-mythical, though we know that a
man of that name did really marry at Stoke Damerel, near
Plymouth, one Mary Gray on 29th December 1733.&nbsp; Gray is an
old Gypsy surname, but the Gypsies of his <i>Life and
Adventures</i> are just as unreal as those of any melodrama or
penny dreadful.</p>
<p>The poet-physician, John Armstrong (<i>c.</i> 1709-78), was at
college at Edinburgh with Mr. Lawrie, who in 1767 was minister of
Hawick; and &ldquo;one year, during the vacation, they joined a
band of gipsies, who in those days much infested the
Borders.&rdquo;&nbsp; So says &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo; Carlyle in
his Autobiography; and he adds that &ldquo;this expedition, which
really took place, as Armstrong informed me <!-- page xix--><a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>in London,
furnished Lawrie with a fine field for fiction and rhodomontade,
so closely united to the groundwork, which might be true, that it
was impossible to discompound them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fourth Lord Coleraine, better known as Colonel George
Hanger (<i>c.</i> 1751-1824), was a wild, harum-scarum
Irishman.&nbsp; According to the Hon. Grantley Berkeley&rsquo;s
<i>My Life and Recollections</i>, &ldquo;in one of his early
rambles he joined a gang of gipsies, fell in love with one of
their dark-eyed beauties, and married her according to the rites
of the tribe.&nbsp; He had entered the footguards in 1771, and
used to introduce his brother-officers to his dusky bride,
boasting his confidence in her fidelity.&nbsp; His married life
went on pleasantly for about a fortnight, at the end of which his
confidence and his bliss were destroyed together, on ascertaining
to his intense disgust that his gipsy inamorata had eloped with a
bandy-legged tinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very unlike the Colonel was the mythologist, Jacob Bryant
(1715-1804).&nbsp; We know the little man, with his thirteen
spaniels, through Madame D&rsquo;Arblay&rsquo;s Diaries; she
often visited Cypenham, his house near Windsor.&nbsp; It must
have been in his garden here that he collected his materials for
the paper &ldquo;On the Zingara or Gypsey Language,&rdquo; which
he read to the Royal Society in 1785.&nbsp; For
&ldquo;<i>covascorook</i>, laurel,&rdquo; is intelligible only by
supposing him to have pointed to a laurel, and asked, &ldquo;What
is this?&rdquo; and by the Gypsy&rsquo;s answering <!-- page
xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>in
words that mean &ldquo;This is a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are a
number of similar slips in the vocabulary, as <i>sauvee</i>, an
eagle (rightly, a needle), <i>porcherie</i>, brass (a halfpenny,
a copper), <i>plastomingree</i>, couch (coach), and
<i>baurobevalacochenos</i>, storm.&nbsp; This last word posed the
etymological skill of even Prof. Pott in his great work on <i>Die
Zigeuner</i>, but he hazards the conjecture that <i>cochenos</i>
may be akin to the Greek &chi;&omicron;&lambda;&eta;; really the
whole may be dismembered into <i>ba&uacute;ro</i>, great,
<i>b&aacute;val</i>, wind, and the English &ldquo;a-catching
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still, Bryant&rsquo;s is not at all a bad
vocabulary.</p>
<p>Edward Bulwer, Lord Lytton (1803-73), tells in a fragment of
autobiography how at twenty-one he met a pretty Gypsy girl at
sunset, was guided by her to the tents, and &ldquo;spent with
these swarthy wanderers five or six very happy days.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He committed his money, fourteen pounds in all, to the care of
the Gypsy grandmother, the queen of the camp, who &ldquo;was
faithful to the customs of the primitive gipsies, and would eat
nothing in the shape of animal food that had not died a natural
death&rdquo;!&nbsp; Mimy, the Gypsy girl, and he make passionate
love, till at last she proposes &ldquo;marriage for five years by
breaking a piece of burnt earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the stars and
the Gypsy brethren forbid the banns, so they part
eternally.&nbsp; It is all the silliest moonshine, the most
impossible Gypsies: no, Bulwer Lytton deserves no place among the
real Romany Ryes.</p>
<p>Of these a whole host remain.&nbsp; Francis Irvine, <!-- page
xxi--><a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>a
lieutenant in the Bengal Native Infantry, on the outward-bound
voyage (1805) to India on board the <i>Preston</i> East Indiaman,
took down a vocabulary of one hundred and thirty Romany words
from John Lee, a Gypsy recruit for the Company&rsquo;s European
force.&nbsp; No other case is known to me of a Gypsy revisiting
the land of his forefathers.&nbsp; John Hoyland (1750-1831), a
Yorkshire Quaker, in 1814 began to study &ldquo;the very
destitute and abject condition&rdquo; of the Midland Gypsies, and
wrote <i>A Historical Survey of the Customs</i>, <i>Habits</i>,
<i>and Present State of the Gypsies</i> (York, 1816).&nbsp; He is
said to &ldquo;have fallen in love with a black-eyed gipsy
girl,&rdquo; but it does not appear that he married her.&nbsp;
Which is a pity; a Gypsy Quakeress would be a charming
fancy.&nbsp; That poor thing, John Clare, the Peasant-Poet
(1793-1864), is said to have &ldquo;joined some gipsies for a
time&rdquo; before 1817; and Richard Bright, M.D. (1789-1858),
famous as the investigator of &ldquo;Bright&rsquo;s
disease,&rdquo; must have known much of Gypsies both abroad and
at home, to be able to write his <i>Travels through Lower
Hungary</i> (1818).&nbsp; James Crabb (1774-1851), Wesleyan
minister at Southampton, and Samuel Roberts (1763-1848),
Sheffield manufacturer, both wrote books on the Gypsies, but were
Gypsy philanthropists rather than Romany Ryes.&nbsp; Still,
Roberts had a very fair knowledge of the language, and at
seventy-seven &ldquo;longed to be a gypsy, and enter a house no
<!-- page xxii--><a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel John Staples Harriot during
his &ldquo;residence in North Hampshire in the years 1819-20 was
led to pay considerable attention to a race of vagrant men,
roaming about the high-roads and lanes in the vicinity of
Whitchurch, Waltham, and Overton&rdquo;; in December 1829 he read
before the Royal Asiatic Society an excellent Romany vocabulary
of over four hundred words.</p>
<p>These were Borrow&rsquo;s chief predecessors, but the list
could be largely extended by making it include such names as
those of Sir John Popham (1531-1607), Lord Chief-Justice of
England; Sir William Sinclair, Lord Justice-General of Scotland
from 1559; Mr. William Sympsoune, a great Scottish doctor of
medicine towards the close of the sixteenth century; the Countess
of Cassillis (1643), who did <i>not</i> elope with Johnnie Faa;
Richard Head (<i>c.</i> 1637-86), the author of <i>The English
Rogue</i>; William Marsden (1754-1836), the Orientalist; John
Wilson (&ldquo;Christopher North,&rdquo; 1785-1854); the Rev.
John Baird, minister of Yetholm 1829-61; G. P. R. James
(1801-60), the novelist; and Sam Bough (1822-78), the
landscape-painter.&nbsp; And after Borrow come many; the
following are but a few of them:&mdash;John Phillip, R.A., Tom
Taylor, the Rev. T. W. Norwood, George S. Phillips
(&ldquo;January Searle&rdquo;), Charles Kingsley, Joseph Sheridan
Le Fanu, Mr. Charles Godfrey Leland (&ldquo;Hans
Breitmann&rdquo;), Prof. Edward Henry Palmer, Sir Richard Burton,
<!-- page xxiii--><a name="pagexxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>Bath C. Smart, M.D., of
Manchester, Mr. H. T. Crofton, Major Whyte-Melville, Mr. Joseph
Lucas, the Rev. R. N. Sanderson, Dr. D. Fearon Ranking, Mr. David
MacRitchie, Mr. G. R. Sims, Mr. George Meredith, Mr. Theodore
Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;F. W. Carew, M.D,&rdquo; and Mr. John
Sampson.</p>
<p>Thus, leaving aside all the foreign Romany Ryes, from the
great engraver Jacques Callot to the present Polish novelist
Sienkiewicz, we see that Borrow was not quite so <i>sui
generis</i> as he claimed for himself, and as others have often
claimed for him.&nbsp; The meagreness of his knowledge of the
Anglo-Gypsy dialect came out in his <i>Word-Book of the
Romany</i> (1874); there must have been over a dozen Englishmen
who have known it far better than he.&nbsp; For his Spanish-Gypsy
vocabulary in <i>The Zincali</i> he certainly drew largely either
on Richard Bright&rsquo;s <i>Travels through Lower Hungary</i> or
on Bright&rsquo;s Spanish authority, whatever that may have
been.&nbsp; His knowledge of the strange history of the Gypsies
was very elementary, of their manners almost more so, and of
their folk-lore practically <i>nil</i>.&nbsp; And yet I would put
George Borrow above every other writer on the Gypsies.&nbsp; In
<i>Lavengro</i> and, to a less degree, in its sequel, <i>The
Romany Rye</i>, he communicates a subtle insight into Gypsydom
that is totally wanting in the works&mdash;mainly
philological&mdash;of Pott, Liebich, Paspati, Miklosich, and
their <!-- page xxiv--><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>confr&egrave;res.&nbsp; Take his
first meeting with Gypsies in the green lane near Norman
Cross.&nbsp; There are flaws in it: he never would have spoken of
the Gypsy beldame as &ldquo;my mother there,&rdquo; nor could he
possibly have guessed that the Romany <i>sap</i> means
&ldquo;snake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet compare it with Maggie
Tulliver&rsquo;s Gypsy adventure in <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>:
how vivid and vigorous the one, how tame and commonplace the
other.&nbsp; I am not going to dilate on the beauties of
<i>Lavengro</i>; they seem to me sufficiently self-evident.&nbsp;
But there is one point about the book that deserves some
considering, its credibility as autobiography.&nbsp; Professor
Knapp, Borrow&rsquo;s biographer, seems to place implicit
confidence in <i>Lavengro</i>; I find myself unable to agree with
him.&nbsp; Borrow may really have written the story of <i>Joseph
Sell</i> for a collection of Christmas tales; he may really have
camped for some weeks as a tinker near Willenhall; &ldquo;Belle
Berners&rdquo; may really have had some prototype; and he may
really have bought the splendid horse of the Willenhall
tavern-keeper, and sold it afterwards at Horncastle.&nbsp; But is
the &ldquo;Man in Black,&rdquo; then, also a reality, and the
&ldquo;Reverend Mr. Platitude,&rdquo; who thanks God that he has
left all his Church of England prejudices in Italy? in other
words, did Tractarianism exist in 1825, eight years before it was
engendered by Keble&rsquo;s sermon?&nbsp; David Haggart, again,
the Scottish Jack Sheppard,&mdash;Borrow describes him as
&ldquo;a lad of some fifteen years,&rdquo; <!-- page xxv--><a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>with
&ldquo;prodigious breadth of chest,&rdquo; and as defeating in
single combat a full-grown baker&rsquo;s apprentice.&nbsp; Borrow
well may have seen him, for in July 1813 he really enlisted as a
drummer in Borrow&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s regiment, newly
quartered in Edinburgh Castle; but he was not fifteen then, only
twelve years old.&nbsp; And the Jew pedlar scene in the first
chapter, and the old apple-woman&rsquo;s son in the
sixty-second!</p>
<p>One might take equal exception to Borrow&rsquo;s pretended
visits to Iceland, Moultan, and Kiachta (he was never within
three thousand miles of Kiachta); to his translation of St.
Luke&rsquo;s Gospel into Basque, of which he had only the merest
smattering; and to his statement to a Cornish clergyman in 1854
that his &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; were due to the effects of Mrs.
Herne&rsquo;s poison&mdash;he had suffered from them seven years
before his Gypsy wanderings.&nbsp; But the strongest proof of his
lax adherence to fact is adduced by Professor Knapp
himself.&nbsp; In chapter xvi. of <i>Lavengro</i>, Borrow relates
how in 1818, at Tombland Fair, Norwich, he doffed his hat to the
great trotting stallion, Marshland Shales, &ldquo;drew a deep
<i>ah</i>! and repeated the words of the old fellows around,
&lsquo;Such a horse as this we shall never see again; a pity that
he is so old.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, but as Professor Knapp has
found out, with his infinite painstaking, Marshland Shales
(1802-35) was not thus paraded until 12th April 1827.</p>
<p><!-- page xxvi--><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span><i>Lavengro</i> <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a> was written in 1843-50, years after the
events recorded there.&nbsp; Several of its petty slips are
probably due to sheer forgetfulness; <i>e.g.</i>, as to the four
&ldquo;airts&rdquo; of Edinburgh Castle, and the
&ldquo;lofty&rdquo; town-walls of Berwick-upon-Tweed.&nbsp; And
the rest, I imagine, were due partly to love of posing, but much
more to an honest desire to produce an amusing and interesting
book.&nbsp; Borrow was not writing a set autobiography, and it
seems rather hard to imagine that he was, and then to come down
on this or that inaccuracy.&nbsp; He did pose, though, all his
life long, and in every one of his writings.&nbsp; He posed to
poor old Esther Faa Blythe, the &ldquo;queen&rdquo; of the
Yetholm Tinklers, when, on entering her little cottage, he
&ldquo;flung his arms up three times into the air, and in an
exceedingly disagreeable voice exclaimed, &lsquo;<i>Sossi your
nav</i>?&rsquo; etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Word-Book</i>, p.
314).&nbsp; He posed shamefully to Lieut.-Col. Elers Napier
(Knapp, i. 308-312); and he posed even to me, a mere lad, when I
saw him thrice in 1872-73, at Ascot, at his house in Hereford
Square, and at the Notting-hill Potteries (<i>Bookman</i>, Feb.
1893, pp. 147-48).&nbsp; Yet, what books he has given us, the
very best of them <i>Lavengro</i>; its fight with the Flaming
<!-- page xxvii--><a name="pagexxvii"></a><span

<h2><!-- page xxix--><a name="pagexxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE TO THE FIRST
EDITION</h2>
<p>In the following pages I have endeavoured to describe a dream,
partly of study, partly of adventure, in which will be found
copious notices of books, and many descriptions of life and
manners, some in a very unusual form.</p>
<p>The scenes of action lie in the British Islands;&mdash;pray be
not displeased, gentle reader, if perchance thou hast imagined
that I was about to conduct thee to distant lands, and didst
promise thyself much instruction and entertainment from what I
might tell thee of them.&nbsp; I do assure thee that thou hast no
reason to be displeased, inasmuch as there are no countries in
the world less known by the British than these selfsame British
Islands, or where more strange things are every day occurring,
whether in road or street, house or dingle.</p>
<p>The time embraces nearly the first quarter of the present
century: this information again may, perhaps, be anything but
agreeable to thee; it is a long time to revert to, but fret not
thyself, many matters which at present much occupy the public
mind originated in some degree towards the latter end of that
period, and some of them will be treated of.</p>
<p><!-- page xxx--><a name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxx</span>The principal actors in this dream, or drama, are, as
you will have gathered from the title-page, a Scholar, a Gypsy,
and a Priest.&nbsp; Should you imagine that these three form one,
permit me to assure you that you are very much mistaken.&nbsp;
Should there be something of the Gypsy manifest in the Scholar,
there is certainly nothing of the Priest.&nbsp; With respect to
the Gypsy&mdash;decidedly the most entertaining character of the
three&mdash;there is certainly nothing of the Scholar or the
Priest in him; and as for the Priest, though there may be
something in him both of scholarship and gypsyism, neither the
Scholar nor the Gypsy would feel at all flattered by being
confounded with him.</p>
<p>Many characters which may be called subordinate will be found,
and it is probable that some of these characters will afford much
more interest to the reader than those styled the
principal.&nbsp; The favourites with the writer are a brave old
soldier and his helpmate, an ancient gentlewoman who sold apples,
and a strange kind of wandering man and his wife.</p>
<p>Amongst the many things attempted in this book is the
encouragement of charity, and free and genial manners, and the
exposure of humbug, of which there are various kinds, but of
which the most perfidious, the most debasing, and the most cruel,
is the humbug of the Priest.</p>
<p>Yet let no one think that irreligion is advocated in this
book.&nbsp; With respect to religious tenets I wish to observe
that I am a member of the Church of England, into whose communion
I was baptized, and to which my forefathers belonged.&nbsp; Its
being the religion in which I was baptized, and of my
forefathers, would be a strong inducement to <!-- page xxxi--><a
name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxi</span>me to
cling to it; for I do not happen to be one of those choice
spirits &ldquo;who turn from their banner when the battle bears
strongly against it, and go over to the enemy,&rdquo; and who
receive at first a hug and a &ldquo;viva,&rdquo; and in the
sequel contempt and spittle in the face; but my chief reason for
belonging to it is, because, of all churches calling themselves
Christian ones, I believe there is none so good, so well founded
upon Scripture, or whose ministers are, upon the whole, so
exemplary in their lives and conversation, so well read in the
book from which they preach, or so versed in general learning, so
useful in their immediate neighbourhoods, or so unwilling to
persecute people of other denominations for matters of
doctrine.</p>
<p>In the communion of this Church, and with the religious
consolation of its ministers, I wish and hope to live and die,
and in its and their defence will at all times be ready, if
required, to speak, though humbly, and to fight, though feebly,
against enemies, whether carnal or spiritual.</p>
<p>And is there no priestcraft in the Church of England?&nbsp;
There is certainly, or rather there was, a modicum of priestcraft
in the Church of England, but I have generally found that those
who are most vehement against the Church of England are chiefly
dissatisfied with her, because there is only a modicum of that
article in her&mdash;were she stuffed to the very cupola with it,
like a certain other Church, they would have much less to say
against the Church of England.</p>
<p>By the other Church, I mean Rome.&nbsp; Its system was once
prevalent in England, and, during the period that it prevailed
there, was more prolific <!-- page xxxii--><a
name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>of
debasement and crime than all other causes united.&nbsp; The
people and the government at last becoming enlightened by means
of the Scripture, spurned it from the island with disgust and
horror, the land instantly after its disappearance becoming a
fair field, in which arts, sciences, and all the amiable virtues
flourished, instead of being a pestilent marsh where swine-like
ignorance wallowed, and artful hypocrites, like so many
Wills-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, played antic gambols about, around, and
above debased humanity.</p>
<p>But Popery still wished to play her old part, to regain her
lost dominion, to reconvert the smiling land into the
pestilential morass, where she could play again her old
antics.&nbsp; From the period of the Reformation in England up to
the present time, she has kept her emissaries here, individuals
contemptible in intellect, it is true, but cat-like and gliding,
who, at her bidding, have endeavoured as much as in their power
has lain, to damp and stifle every genial, honest, loyal, and
independent thought, and to reduce minds to such a state of
dotage as would enable their old popish mother to do what she
pleased with them.</p>
<p>And in every country, however enlightened, there are always
minds inclined to grovelling superstition&mdash;minds fond of
eating dust, and swallowing clay&mdash;minds never at rest, save
when prostrate before some fellow in a surplice; and these popish
emissaries found always some weak enough to bow down before them,
astounded by their dreadful denunciations of eternal woe and
damnation to any who should refuse to believe their Romania; but
they played a poor game&mdash;the law protected the servants of
Scripture, and <!-- page xxxiii--><a name="pagexxxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxiii</span>the priest with his beads seldom
ventured to approach any but the remnant of those of the
eikonolatry&mdash;representatives of worm-eaten houses, their
debased dependants, and a few poor crazy creatures amongst the
middle classes&mdash;he played a poor game, and the labour was
about to prove almost entirely in vain, when the English
legislature, in compassion or contempt, or, yet more probably,
influenced by that spirit of toleration and kindness which is so
mixed up with Protestantism, removed almost entirely the
disabilities under which Popery laboured, and enabled it to raise
its head and to speak out almost without fear.</p>
<p>And it did raise its head, and, though it spoke with some
little fear at first, soon discarded every relic of it; went
about the land uttering its damnation cry, gathering around
it&mdash;and for doing so many thanks to it&mdash;the favourers
of priestcraft who lurked within the walls of the Church of
England; frightening with the loudness of its voice the weak, the
timid, and the ailing; perpetrating, whenever it had an
opportunity, that species of crime to which it has ever been most
partial&mdash;<i>Deathbed robbery</i>; for as it is cruel, so is
it dastardly.&nbsp; Yes, it went on enlisting, plundering, and
uttering its terrible threats till . . . till it became, as it
always does when left to itself, a fool, a very fool.&nbsp; Its
plunderings might have been overlooked, and so might its
insolence, had it been common insolence, but it . . ., and then
the roar of indignation which arose from outraged England against
the viper, the frozen viper which it had permitted to warm itself
upon its bosom.</p>
<p>But thanks, Popery, you have done all that the friends of
enlightenment and religious liberty could <!-- page xxxiv--><a
name="pagexxxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxiv</span>wish;
but if ever there were a set of foolish ones to be found under
Heaven, surely it is the priestly rabble who came over from Rome
to direct the grand movement&mdash;so long in its getting up.</p>
<p>But now again the damnation cry is withdrawn, there is a
subdued meekness in your demeanour, you are now once more
harmless as a lamb.&nbsp; Well, we shall see how the
trick&mdash;&ldquo;the old trick&rdquo;&mdash;will serve you.</p>

<p>On an evening of July, in the year 18--, at East D---, a
beautiful little town in a certain district of East Anglia, I
first saw the light. <a name="citation1a"></a><a
href="#footnote1a" class="citation">[1a]</a></p>
<p>My father was a Cornish man, the youngest, as I have heard him
say, of seven brothers. <a name="citation1b"></a><a
href="#footnote1b" class="citation">[1b]</a>&nbsp; He sprang from
a family of gentlemen, or, as some people would call them,
gentill&acirc;tres, for they were not very wealthy; they had a
coat of arms, however, and lived on their own property at a place
called Tredinnock, <a name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c"
class="citation">[1c]</a> which being interpreted means <i>the
house on the hill</i>, which house and the neighbouring acres had
been from time immemorial in their possession.&nbsp; I mention
these particulars that the reader may <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>see at once
that I am not altogether of low and plebeian origin; the present
age is highly aristocratic, and I am convinced that the public
will read my pages with more zest from being told that I am a
gentill&acirc;tre by birth with Cornish blood <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> in my veins, of a family who lived on
their own property at a place bearing a Celtic name signifying
the house on the hill, or more strictly the house on the
<i>hillock</i>.</p>
<p>My father was what is generally termed a posthumous
child&mdash;in other words, the gentill&acirc;tre who begot him
never had the satisfaction of invoking the blessing of the Father
of All upon his head; having departed this life some months
before the birth of his youngest son.&nbsp; The boy, therefore,
never knew a father&rsquo;s care; he was, however, well tended by
his mother, whose favourite he was; so much so, indeed, that his
brethren, the youngest of whom was considerably older than
himself, were rather jealous of him.&nbsp; I never heard,
however, that they treated him with any marked unkindness; and it
will be as well to observe here that I am by no means well
acquainted with his early history, of which, indeed, as I am not
writing his life, it is not necessary to say much.&nbsp; Shortly
after his mother&rsquo;s death, which occurred when he was
eighteen, he adopted the profession of arms, which he followed
during the remainder of his life, and in which, had circumstances
permitted, he would probably have shone amongst the best.&nbsp;
By nature he was cool and collected, slow to anger, though
perfectly fearless, patient of control, of great strength; and,
to crown all, a proper man with his hands.</p>
<p>With far inferior qualifications many a man has <!-- page
3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>become a
field-marshal or general; similar ones made Tamerlane, who was
not a gentill&acirc;tre, but the son of a blacksmith, emperor of
one-third of the world; but the race is not always for the swift,
nor the battle for the strong, indeed I ought rather to say very
seldom; certain it is, that my father, with all his high military
qualifications, never became emperor, field-marshal, or even
general: indeed, he had never an opportunity of distinguishing
himself save in one battle, and that took place neither in
Flanders, Egypt, nor on the banks of the Indus or Oxus, but in
Hyde Park.</p>
<p>Smile not, gentle reader, many a battle has been fought in
Hyde Park, in which as much skill, science, and bravery have been
displayed as ever achieved a victory in Flanders or by the
Indus.&nbsp; In such a combat as that to which I allude, I opine
that even Wellington or Napoleon would have been heartily glad to
cry for quarter ere the lapse of five minutes, and even the
Blacksmith Tartar would, perhaps, have shrunk from the opponent
with whom, after having had a dispute with him, my father engaged
in single combat for one hour, at the end of which time the
champions shook hands and retired, each having experienced quite
enough of the other&rsquo;s prowess.&nbsp; The name of my
father&rsquo;s antagonist was Brain.</p>
<p>What! still a smile? did you never hear that name
before?&nbsp; I cannot help it!&nbsp; Honour to Brain, who four
months after the event which I have now narrated was champion of
England, having conquered the heroic Johnson.&nbsp; Honour to
Brain, who, at the end of other four months, worn out by the
dreadful blows which he had received in his manly combats,
expired in the arms of my <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>father, who read the Bible to him in
his latter moments&mdash;Big Ben Brain.</p>
<p>You no longer smile, even <i>you</i> have heard of Big
Ben.</p>
<p>I have already hinted that my father never rose to any very
exalted rank in his profession, notwithstanding his prowess and
other qualifications.&nbsp; After serving for many years in the
line, he at last entered as captain in the militia regiment of
the Earl of ---, <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a> at that period just raised, and to
which he was sent by the Duke of York to instruct the young
levies in military man&oelig;uvres and discipline; and in this
mission I believe he perfectly succeeded, competent judges having
assured me that the regiment in question soon came by his means
to be considered as one of the most brilliant in the service, and
inferior to no regiment of the line in appearance or
discipline.</p>
<p>As the headquarters of this corps were at D---, <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> the duties of my father not
unfrequently carried him to that place, and it was on one of
these occasions that he became acquainted with a young person of
the neighbourhood, for whom he formed an attachment, which was
returned; and this young person was my mother. <a
name="citation4c"></a><a href="#footnote4c"
class="citation">[4c]</a></p>
<p>She was descended from a family of French Protestants, natives
of Caen, who were obliged to leave their native country when old
Louis, <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>at the instigation of the Pope, thought fit to revoke the
Edict of Nantes: their name was Petrement, and I have reason for
believing that they were people of some consideration; that they
were noble hearts, and good Christians, they gave sufficient
proof in scorning to bow the knee to the tyranny of Rome.&nbsp;
So they left beautiful Normandy for their faith&rsquo;s sake, and
with a few louis d&rsquo;ors in their purse, a Bible in the
vulgar tongue, and a couple of old swords, which, if report be
true, had done service in the Huguenot wars, they crossed the sea
to the isle of civil peace and religious liberty, and established
themselves in East Anglia.</p>
<p>And many other Huguenot families bent their steps thither, and
devoted themselves to agriculture or the mechanical arts; and in
the venerable old city, the capital of the province, in the
northern shadow of the Castle of De Burgh, the exiles built for
themselves a church where they praised God in the French tongue,
and to which, at particular seasons of the year, they were in the
habit of flocking from country and from town to sing&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast provided for us a goodly earth; Thou waterest
her furrows, Thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof,
Thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the
increase of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been told that in her younger days my mother was
strikingly handsome; this I can easily believe: I never knew her
in her youth, for though she was very young when she married my
father (who was her senior by many years), she had attained the
middle age before I was born, no children having been vouchsafed
to my parents in the early stages of their union.&nbsp; Yet even
at the <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>present day, now that years threescore and ten have
passed over her head, attended with sorrow and troubles manifold,
poorly chequered with scanty joys, can I look on that countenance
and doubt that at one time beauty decked it as with a glorious
garment?&nbsp; Hail to thee, my parent! as thou sittest there, in
thy widow&rsquo;s weeds, in the dusky parlour in the house
overgrown with the lustrous ivy of the sister isle, the solitary
house at the end of the retired court shaded by lofty
poplars.&nbsp; Hail to thee, dame of the oval face, olive
complexion, and Grecian forehead! by thy table seated with the
mighty volume of the good Bishop Hopkins spread out before thee;
there is peace in thy countenance, my mother; it is not worldly
peace, however, not the deceitful peace which lulls to bewitching
slumbers, and from which, let us pray, humbly pray, that every
sinner may be roused in time to implore mercy not in vain!&nbsp;
Thine is the peace of the righteous, my mother, of those to whom
no sin can be imputed, the score of whose misdeeds has been long
since washed away by the blood of atonement, which imputeth
righteousness to those who trust in it.&nbsp; It was not always
thus, my mother; a time was, when the cares, pomps, and vanities
of this world agitated thee too much; but that time is gone by,
another and a better has succeeded; there is peace now on thy
countenance, the true peace; peace around thee, too, in thy
solitary dwelling, sounds of peace, the cheerful hum of the
kettle and the purring of the immense angola, which stares up at
thee from its settle with its almost human eyes.</p>
<p>No more earthly cares and affections now, my mother!&nbsp;
Yes, one.&nbsp; Why dost thou suddenly <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>raise thy dark
and still brilliant eye from the volume with a somewhat startled
glance?&nbsp; What noise is that in the distant street?&nbsp;
Merely the noise of a hoof; a sound common enough: it draws
nearer, nearer, and now it stops before thy gate.&nbsp;
Singular!&nbsp; And now there is a pause, a long pause.&nbsp; Ha!
thou hearest something&mdash;a footstep; a swift but heavy
footstep! thou risest, thou tremblest, there is a hand on the pin
of the outer door, there is some one in the vestibule, and now
the door of thy apartment opens, there is a reflection on the
mirror behind thee, a travelling hat, a grey head and sunburnt
face.&nbsp; My dearest Son!&nbsp; My darling Mother!</p>
<p>Yes, mother, thou didst recognise in the distant street the
hoof-tramp of the wanderer&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>I was not the only child of my parents; I had a brother some
three years older than myself. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; He was a
beautiful child; one of those occasionally seen in England, and
in England alone; a rosy, angelic face, blue eyes, and light
chestnut hair; it was not exactly an Anglo-Saxon countenance, in
which, by the bye, there is generally a cast of loutishness and
stupidity; it partook, to a certain extent, of the Celtic
character, particularly in the fire and vivacity which illumined
it; his face was the mirror of his mind; perhaps no disposition
more amiable was ever found amongst the children of Adam, united,
however, with no inconsiderable portion of high and dauntless
spirit.&nbsp; So great was his beauty in infancy, that people,
especially those <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of the poorer classes, would follow
the nurse who carried him about in order to look at and bless his
lovely face.&nbsp; At the age of three months an attempt was made
to snatch him from his mother&rsquo;s arms in the streets of
London, at the moment she was about to enter a coach; indeed, his
appearance seemed to operate so powerfully upon every person who
beheld him, that my parents were under continual apprehension of
losing him; his beauty, however, was perhaps surpassed by the
quickness of his parts.&nbsp; He mastered his letters in a few
hours, and in a day or two could decipher the names of people on
the doors of houses and over the shop-windows.</p>
<p>As he grew up, his personal appearance became less
prepossessing, his quickness and cleverness, however, rather
increased; and I may say of him, that with respect to everything
which he took in hand he did it better and more speedily than any
other person.&nbsp; Perhaps it will be asked here, what became of
him?&nbsp; Alas! alas! his was an early and a foreign
grave.&nbsp; As I have said before, the race is not always for
the swift, nor the battle for the strong.</p>
<p>And now, doubtless, after the above portrait of my brother,
painted in the very best style of Rubens, the reader will
conceive himself justified in expecting a full-length one of
myself, as a child, for as to my present appearance, I suppose he
will be tolerably content with that flitting glimpse in the
mirror.&nbsp; But he must excuse me; I have no intention of
drawing a portrait of myself in childhood; indeed it would be
difficult, for at that time I never looked into mirrors.&nbsp; No
attempts, however, were ever made to steal me in my <!-- page
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>infancy,
and I never heard that my parents entertained the slightest
apprehension of losing me by the hands of kidnappers, though I
remember perfectly well that people were in the habit of standing
still to look at me, ay, more than at my brother; from which
premises the reader may form any conclusion with respect to my
appearance which seemeth good unto him and reasonable.&nbsp;
Should he, being a good-natured person, and always inclined to
adopt the charitable side in any doubtful point, be willing to
suppose that I, too, was eminently endowed by nature with
personal graces, I tell him frankly that I have no objection
whatever to his entertaining that idea; moreover, that I heartily
thank him, and shall at all times be disposed, under similar
circumstances, to exercise the same species of charity towards
himself.</p>
<p>With respect to my mind and its qualities I shall be more
explicit; for, were I to maintain much reserve on this point,
many things which appear in these memoirs would be highly
mysterious to the reader, indeed incomprehensible.&nbsp; Perhaps
no two individuals were ever more unlike in mind and disposition
than my brother and myself: as light is opposed to darkness, so
was that happy, brilliant, cheerful child to the sad and
melancholy being who sprang from the same stock as himself, and
was nurtured by the same milk.</p>
<p>Once, when travelling in an Alpine country, I arrived at a
considerable elevation; I saw in the distance, far below, a
beautiful stream hastening to the ocean, its rapid waters here
sparkling in the sunshine, and there tumbling merrily in
cascades.&nbsp; On its banks were vineyards and cheerful
villages; close to where I stood, in a granite basin, with <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>steep and precipitous sides, slumbered a deep, dark
lagoon, shaded by black pines, cypresses, and yews.&nbsp; It was
a wild, savage spot, strange and singular; ravens hovered above
the pines, filling the air with their uncouth notes, pies
chattered, and I heard the cry of an eagle from a neighbouring
peak; there lay the lake, the dark, solitary, and almost
inaccessible lake; gloomy shadows were upon it, which, strangely
modified as gusts of wind agitated the surface, occasionally
assumed the shape of monsters.&nbsp; So I stood on the Alpine
elevation, and looked now on the gay distant river, and now at
the dark granite-encircled lake close beside me in the lone
solitude, and I thought of my brother and myself.&nbsp; I am no
moraliser; but the gay and rapid river, and the dark and silent
lake, were, of a verity, no bad emblems of us two.</p>
<p>So far from being quick and clever like my brother, and able
to rival the literary feat which I have recorded of him, many
years elapsed before I was able to understand the nature of
letters, or to connect them.&nbsp; A lover of nooks and retired
corners, I was as a child in the habit of fleeing from society,
and of sitting for hours together with my head on my
breast.&nbsp; What I was thinking about, it would be difficult to
say at this distance of time; I remember perfectly well, however,
being ever conscious of a peculiar heaviness within me, and at
times of a strange sensation of fear, which occasionally amounted
to horror, and for which I could assign no real cause
whatever.</p>
<p>By nature slow of speech, I took no pleasure in conversation,
nor in hearing the voices of my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; When
people addressed me, I not unfrequently, especially if they were
strangers, <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>turned away my head from them, and if
they persisted in their notice burst into tears, which
singularity of behaviour by no means tended to dispose people in
my favour.&nbsp; I was as much disliked as my brother was
deservedly beloved and admired.&nbsp; My parents, it is true,
were always kind to me; and my brother, who was good-nature
itself, was continually lavishing upon me every mark of
affection.</p>
<p>There was, however, one individual who, in the days of my
childhood, was disposed to form a favourable opinion of me.&nbsp;
One day, a Jew&mdash;I have quite forgotten the circumstance, but
I was long subsequently informed of it&mdash;one day a travelling
Jew knocked at the door of a farmhouse in which we had taken
apartments; I was near at hand, sitting in the bright sunshine,
drawing strange lines on the dust with my fingers, an ape and dog
were my companions; the Jew looked at me and asked me some
questions, to which, though I was quite able to speak, I returned
no answer.&nbsp; On the door being opened, the Jew, after a few
words, probably relating to pedlary, demanded who the child was,
sitting in the sun; the maid replied that I was her
mistress&rsquo;s youngest son, a child weak <i>here</i>, pointing
to her forehead.&nbsp; The Jew looked at me again, and then said,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my conscience, my dear, I believe that you must
be troubled there yourself to tell me any such thing.&nbsp; It is
not my habit to speak to children, inasmuch as I hate them,
because they often follow me and fling stones after me; but I no
sooner looked at that child than I was forced to speak to
it&mdash;his not answering me shows his sense, for it has never
been the custom of the wise to fling away their words in
indifferent talk <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and conversation; the child is a
sweet child, and has all the look of one of our people&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; Fool, indeed! did I not see his eyes sparkle just
now when the monkey seized the dog by the ear?&mdash;they shone
like my own diamonds&mdash;does your good lady want
any&mdash;real and fine?&nbsp; Were it not for what you tell me,
I should say it was a prophet&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; Fool, indeed!
he can write already, or I&rsquo;ll forfeit the box which I carry
on my back, and for which I should be loth to take two hundred
pounds!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then leaned forward to inspect the lines
which I had traced.&nbsp; All of a sudden he started back, and
grew white as a sheet; then, taking off his hat, he made some
strange gestures to me, cringing, chattering, and showing his
teeth, and shortly departed, muttering something about
&ldquo;holy letters,&rdquo; and talking to himself in a strange
tongue.&nbsp; The words of the Jew were in due course of time
reported to my mother, who treasured them in her heart, and from
that moment began to entertain brighter hopes of her youngest
born than she had ever before ventured to foster.</p>

Skull&mdash;Superhuman Stature&mdash;Stirring Times&mdash;The
Sea-Board.</p>
<p>I have been a wanderer the greater part of my life; indeed I
remember only two periods, and these by no means lengthy, when I
was, strictly speaking, stationary.&nbsp; I was a soldier&rsquo;s
son, and as the means of my father were by no means sufficient to
support two establishments, his family invariably attended him
wherever he went, so that from my infancy I was accustomed to
travelling and wandering, and looked upon a monthly change of
scene and residence as a matter of course.&nbsp; Sometimes we
lived in barracks, sometimes in lodgings, but generally in the
former, always eschewing the latter from motives of economy, save
when the barracks were inconvenient and uncomfortable; and they
must have been highly so indeed, to have discouraged us from
entering them; for though we were gentry (pray bear that in mind,
gentle reader), gentry by birth, and incontestably so by my
father&rsquo;s bearing the commission of good old George the
Third, we were not <i>fine gentry</i>, but people who <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>could
put up with as much as any genteel Scotch family who find it
convenient to live on a third floor in London, or on a sixth at
Edinburgh or Glasgow.&nbsp; It was not a little that could
discourage us: we once lived within the canvas walls of a camp,
at a place called Pett, in Sussex; and I believe it was at this
place that occurred the first circumstance, or adventure, call it
which you will, that I can remember in connection with myself: it
was a strange one, and I will relate it.</p>
<p>It happened that my brother and myself were playing one
evening in a sandy lane, in the neighbourhood of this Pett camp;
our mother was at a slight distance.&nbsp; All of a sudden, a
bright yellow, and, to my infantine eye, beautiful and glorious,
object made its appearance at the top of the bank from between
the thick quickset, and, gliding down, began to move across the
lane to the other side, like a line of golden light.&nbsp;
Uttering a cry of pleasure, I sprang forward, and seized it
nearly by the middle.&nbsp; A strange sensation of numbing
coldness seemed to pervade my whole arm, which surprised me the
more, as the object to the eye appeared so warm and
sunlike.&nbsp; I did not drop it, however, but, holding it up,
looked at it intently, as its head dangled about a foot from my
hand.&nbsp; It made no resistance; I felt not even the slightest
struggle; but now my brother began to scream and shriek like one
possessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;O mother, mother!&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;the viper!&mdash;my brother has a viper in his
hand!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then, like one frantic, made an effort to
snatch the creature away from me.&nbsp; The viper now hissed
amain, and raised its head, in which were eyes like hot coals,
menacing, not myself, but my brother.&nbsp; I dropped my captive,
for I saw my <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>mother running towards me; and the
reptile, after standing for a moment nearly erect, and still
hissing furiously, made off, and disappeared.&nbsp; The whole
scene is now before me, as vividly as if it occurred
yesterday&mdash;the gorgeous viper, my poor dear frantic brother,
my agitated parent, and a frightened hen clucking under the
bushes&mdash;and yet I was not three years old!</p>
<p>It is my firm belief that certain individuals possess an
inherent power, or fascination, over certain creatures, otherwise
I should be unable to account for many feats which I have
witnessed, and, indeed, borne a share in, connected with the
taming of brutes and reptiles.&nbsp; I have known a savage and
vicious mare, whose stall it was dangerous to approach, even when
bearing provender, welcome, nevertheless, with every appearance
of pleasure, an uncouth, wiry-headed man, with a frightfully
seamed face, and an iron hook supplying the place of his right
hand, one whom the animal had never seen before, playfully bite
his hair, and cover his face with gentle and endearing kisses;
and I have already stated how a viper would permit, without
resentment, one child to take it up in his hand, whilst it showed
its dislike to the approach of another by the fiercest
hissings.&nbsp; Philosophy can explain many strange things, but
there are some which are a far pitch above her, and this is
one.</p>
<p>I should scarcely relate another circumstance which occurred
about this time but for a singular effect which it produced upon
my constitution.&nbsp; Up to this period I had been rather a
delicate child; whereas almost immediately after the occurrence
to which I allude I became both hale and vigorous, to the great
astonishment of my <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>parents, who naturally enough
expected that it would produce quite a contrary effect.</p>
<p>It happened that my brother and myself were disporting
ourselves in certain fields near the good town of
Canterbury.&nbsp; A female servant had attended us, in order to
take care that we came to no mischief: she, however, it seems,
had matters of her own to attend to, and, allowing us to go where
we listed, remained in one corner of a field, in earnest
conversation with a red-coated dragoon.&nbsp; Now it chanced to
be blackberry time, and the two children wandered under the
hedges, peering anxiously among them in quest of that trash so
grateful to urchins of their degree.&nbsp; We did not find much
of it, however, and were soon separated in the pursuit.&nbsp; All
at once I stood still, and could scarcely believe my eyes.&nbsp;
I had come to a spot where, almost covering the hedge, hung
clusters of what seemed fruit&mdash;deliciously-tempting
fruit&mdash;something resembling grapes of various colours,
green, red, and purple.&nbsp; Dear me, thought I, how fortunate!
yet have I a right to gather it? is it mine? for the observance
of the law of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> had early been
impressed upon my mind, and I entertained, even at that tender
age, the utmost horror for theft; so I stood staring at the
variegated clusters, in doubt as to what I should do.&nbsp; I
know not how I argued the matter in my mind; the temptation,
however, was at last too strong for me, so I stretched forth my
hand and ate.&nbsp; I remember, perfectly well, that the taste of
this strange fruit was by no means so pleasant as the appearance;
but the idea of eating fruit was sufficient for a child, and,
after all, the flavour was much superior to that of sour apples,
so I ate <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>voraciously.&nbsp; How long I
continued eating I scarcely know.&nbsp; One thing is certain,
that I never left the field as I entered it, being carried home
in the arms of the dragoon in strong convulsions, in which I
continued for several hours.&nbsp; About midnight I awoke, as if
from a troubled sleep, and beheld my parents bending over my
couch, whilst the regimental surgeon, with a candle in his hand,
stood nigh, the light feebly reflected on the whitewashed walls
of the barrack-room.</p>
<p>Another circumstance connected with my infancy, and I have
done.&nbsp; I need offer no apology for relating it, as it
subsequently exercised considerable influence over my
pursuits.&nbsp; We were, if I remember right, in the vicinity of
a place called Hythe, in Kent.&nbsp; One sweet evening, in the
latter part of summer, our mother took her two little boys by the
hand, for a wander about the fields.&nbsp; In the course of our
stroll, we came to the village church; an old, grey-headed sexton
stood in the porch, who, perceiving that we were strangers,
invited us to enter.&nbsp; We were presently in the interior,
wandering about the aisles, looking on the walls, and inspecting
the monuments of the notable dead.&nbsp; I can scarcely state
what we saw; how should I?&nbsp; I was a child not yet four years
old, and yet I think I remember the evening sun streaming in
through a stained window upon the dingy mahogany pulpit, and
flinging a rich lustre upon the faded tints of an ancient
banner.&nbsp; And now once more we were outside the building,
where, against the wall, stood a low-eaved pent-house, into which
we looked.&nbsp; It was half filled with substances of some kind,
which at first looked <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>like large grey stones.&nbsp; The
greater part were lying in layers; some, however, were seen in
confused and mouldering heaps, and two or three, which had
perhaps rolled down from the rest, lay separately on the
floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Skulls, madam,&rdquo; said the sexton;
&ldquo;skulls of the old Danes!&nbsp; Long ago they came pirating
into these parts; and then there chanced a mighty shipwreck, for
God was angry with them, and He sunk them; and their skulls, as
they came ashore, were placed here as a memorial.&nbsp; There
were many more when I was young, but now they are fast
disappearing.&nbsp; Some of them must have belonged to strange
fellows, madam.&nbsp; Only see that one; why, the two young
gentry can scarcely lift it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, indeed, my brother
and myself had entered the Golgotha, and commenced handling these
grim relics of mortality.&nbsp; One enormous skull, lying in a
corner, had fixed our attention, and we had drawn it forth.&nbsp;
Spirit of eld, what a skull was yon!</p>
<p>I still seem to see it, the huge grim thing; many of the
others were large, strikingly so, and appeared fully to justify
the old man&rsquo;s conclusion, that their owners must have been
strange fellows; but compared with this mighty mass of bone they
looked small and diminutive, like those of pigmies; it must have
belonged to a giant, one of those red-haired warriors of whose
strength and stature such wondrous tales are told in the ancient
chronicles of the north, and whose grave-hills, when ransacked,
occasionally reveal secrets which fill the minds of puny moderns
with astonishment and awe.&nbsp; Reader, have you ever pored days
and nights over the pages of Snorro?&mdash;probably not, for he
wrote in a language which few of the present day understand, <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>and few would be tempted to read him tamed down by Latin
dragomans.&nbsp; A brave old book is that of Snorro, containing
the histories and adventures of old northern kings and champions,
who seemed to have been quite different men, if we may judge from
the feats which they performed, from those of these days.&nbsp;
One of the best of his histories is that which describes the life
of Harald Haardraade, who, after manifold adventures by land and
sea, now a pirate, now a mercenary of the Greek emperor, became
king of Norway, and eventually perished at the battle of Stamford
Bridge, whilst engaged in a gallant onslaught upon England.&nbsp;
Now, I have often thought that the old Kemp, whose mouldering
skull in the Golgotha of Hythe my brother and myself could
scarcely lift, must have resembled in one respect at least this
Harald, whom Snorro describes as a great and wise ruler and a
determined leader, dangerous in battle, of fair presence, and
measuring in height <i>just five ells</i>, <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> neither more nor less.</p>
<p>I never forgot the Daneman&rsquo;s skull; like the apparition
of the viper in the sandy lane, it dwelt in the mind of the boy,
affording copious food for the exercise of imagination.&nbsp;
From that moment with the name of Dane were associated strange
ideas of strength, daring, and superhuman stature; and an
undefinable curiosity for all that is connected with the Danish
race began to pervade me; and if, long after, when I became a
student, I devoted myself with peculiar zest to Danish lore and
the acquirement of the old Norse tongue and its dialects, I can
only explain the matter by the early impression received at Hythe
from the tale of the <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>old sexton, beneath the pent-house,
and the sight of the Danish skull.</p>
<p>And thus we went on straying from place to place, at Hythe
to-day, and perhaps within a week looking out from our
hostel-window upon the streets of old Winchester, our motions
ever in accordance with the &ldquo;route&rdquo; of the regiment,
so habituated to change of scene that it had become almost
necessary to our existence.&nbsp; Pleasant were these days of my
early boyhood; and a melancholy pleasure steals over me as I
recall them.&nbsp; Those were stirring times of which I am
speaking, and there was much passing around me calculated to
captivate the imagination.&nbsp; The dreadful struggle which so
long convulsed Europe, and in which England bore so prominent a
part, was then at its hottest; we were at war, and determination
and enthusiasm shone in every face; man, woman, and child were
eager to fight the Frank, the hereditary, but, thank God, never
dreaded enemy of the Anglo-Saxon race.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love your
country and beat the French, and then never mind what
happens,&rdquo; was the cry of entire England.&nbsp; Oh, those
were days of power, gallant days, bustling days, worth the
bravest days of chivalry at least; tall battalions of native
warriors were marching through the land; there was the glitter of
the bayonet and the gleam of the sabre; the shrill squeak of the
fife and loud rattling of the drum were heard in the streets of
country towns, and the loyal shouts of the inhabitants greeted
the soldiery on their arrival, or cheered them at their
departure.&nbsp; And now let us leave the upland, and descend to
the sea-board; there is a sight for you upon the billows!&nbsp; A
dozen men-of-war are gliding <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>majestically
out of port, their long buntings streaming from the top-gallant
masts, calling on the skulking Frenchman to come forth from his
bights and bays; and what looms upon us yonder from the fog-bank
in the east? a gallant frigate towing behind her the long low
hull of a crippled privateer, which but three short days ago had
left Dieppe to skim the sea, and whose crew of ferocious hearts
are now cursing their imprudence in an English hold.&nbsp;
Stirring times those, which I love to recall, for they were days
of gallantry and enthusiasm, and were moreover the days of my
boyhood.</p>

<p>And when I was between six and seven years of age we were once
more at D---, <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> the place of my birth, whither my
father had been despatched on the recruiting service.&nbsp; I
have already said that it was a beautiful little town&mdash;at
least it was at the time of which I am speaking; what it is at
present I know not, for thirty years and more have elapsed since
I last trod its streets.&nbsp; It will scarcely have improved,
for how could it be better than it then was?&nbsp; I love to
think on thee, pretty quiet D---, thou pattern of an English
country town, with thy clean but narrow streets branching out
from thy modest market-place, with thine old-fashioned houses,
with here and there a roof of venerable thatch, with thy one
half-aristocratic mansion, where resided thy Lady
Bountiful&mdash;she, the generous and kind, who loved to visit
the sick, leaning on her gold-headed cane, <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>whilst the
sleek old footman walked at a respectful distance behind.&nbsp;
Pretty quiet D---, with thy venerable church, in which moulder
the mortal remains of England&rsquo;s sweetest and most pious
bard.</p>
<p>Yes, pretty D---, I could always love thee, were it but for
the sake of him who sleeps beneath the marble slab in yonder
quiet chancel.&nbsp; It was within thee that the long-oppressed
bosom heaved its last sigh, and the crushed and gentle spirit
escaped from a world in which it had known nought but
sorrow.&nbsp; Sorrow! do I say?&nbsp; How faint a word to express
the misery of that bruised reed; misery so dark that a blind worm
like myself is occasionally tempted to exclaim, Better had the
world never been created than that one so kind, so harmless, and
so mild, should have undergone such intolerable woe!&nbsp; But it
is over now, for, as there is an end of joy, so has affliction
its termination.&nbsp; Doubtless the All-wise did not afflict him
without a cause: who knows but within that unhappy frame lurked
vicious seeds which the sunbeams of joy and prosperity might have
called into life and vigour?&nbsp; Perhaps the withering blasts
of misery nipped that which otherwise might have terminated in
fruit noxious and lamentable.&nbsp; But peace to the unhappy one,
he is gone to his rest; the deathlike face is no longer
occasionally seen timidly and mournfully looking for a moment
through the window-pane upon thy market-place, quiet and pretty
D---; the hind in thy neighbourhood no longer at evening-fall
views, and starts as he views, the dark lathy figure moving
beneath the hazels and alders of shadowy lanes, or by the side of
murmuring trout streams; and no longer at early <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>dawn does the
sexton of the old church reverently doff his hat, as, supported
by some kind friend, the death-stricken creature totters along
the church-path to that mouldering edifice with the low roof,
inclosing a spring of sanatory waters, built and devoted to some
saint&mdash;if the legend over the door be true, by the daughter
of an East Anglian king.</p>
<p>But to return to my own history.&nbsp; I had now attained the
age of six: shall I state what intellectual progress I had been
making up to this period?&nbsp; Alas! upon this point I have
little to say calculated to afford either pleasure or
edification.&nbsp; I had increased rapidly in size and in
strength: the growth of the mind, however, had by no means
corresponded with that of the body.&nbsp; It is true, I had
acquired my letters, and was by this time able to read
imperfectly; but this was all: and even this poor triumph over
absolute ignorance would never have been effected but for the
unremitting attention of my parents, who, sometimes by threats,
sometimes by entreaties, endeavoured to rouse the dormant
energies of my nature, and to bend my wishes to the acquisition
of the rudiments of knowledge; but in influencing the wish lay
the difficulty.&nbsp; Let but the will of a human being be turned
to any particular object, and it is ten to one that sooner or
later he achieves it.&nbsp; At this time I may safely say that I
harboured neither wishes nor hopes; I had as yet seen no object
calculated to call them forth, and yet I took pleasure in many
things which perhaps unfortunately were all within my sphere of
enjoyment.&nbsp; I loved to look upon the heavens, and to bask in
the rays of the sun, or to sit beneath hedgerows and listen to
the chirping of the birds, indulging the while in <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>musing and meditation as far as my very limited circle
of ideas would permit; but, unlike my brother, who was at this
time at school, and whose rapid progress in every branch of
instruction astonished and delighted his preceptors, I took no
pleasure in books, whose use, indeed, I could scarcely
comprehend, and bade fair to be as arrant a dunce as ever brought
the blush of shame into the cheeks of anxious and affectionate
parents.</p>
<p>But the time was now at hand when the ice which had hitherto
bound the mind of the child with its benumbing power was to be
thawed, and a world of sensations and ideas awakened to which it
had hitherto been an entire stranger.&nbsp; One day a young lady,
an intimate acquaintance of our family, and godmother to my
brother, drove up to the house in which we dwelt; she staid some
time conversing with my mother, and on rising to depart she put
down on the table a small packet, exclaiming, &ldquo;I have
brought a little present for each of the boys: the one is a
History of England, which I intend for my godson when he returns
from school, the other is . . .&rdquo;&mdash;and here she said
something which escaped my ear, as I sat at some distance, moping
in a corner,&mdash;&ldquo;I intend it for the youngster
yonder,&rdquo; pointing to myself; she then departed, and, my
mother going out shortly after, I was left alone.</p>
<p>I remember for some time sitting motionless in my corner, with
my eyes bent upon the ground; at last I lifted my head and looked
upon the packet as it lay on the table.&nbsp; All at once a
strange sensation came over me, such as I had never experienced
before&mdash;a singular blending of curiosity, awe, and pleasure,
the remembrance of which, even <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>at this
distance of time, produces a remarkable effect upon my nervous
system.&nbsp; What strange things are the nerves&mdash;I mean
those more secret and mysterious ones in which I have some notion
that the mind or soul, call it which you will, has its
habitation; how they occasionally tingle and vibrate before any
coming event closely connected with the future weal or woe of the
human being.&nbsp; Such a feeling was now within me, certainly
independent of what the eye had seen or the ear had heard.&nbsp;
A book of some description had been brought for me, a present by
no means calculated to interest me; what cared I for books?&nbsp;
I had already many into which I never looked but from compulsion;
friends, moreover, had presented me with similar things before,
which I had entirely disregarded, and what was there in this
particular book, whose very title I did not know, calculated to
attract me more than the rest? yet something within told me that
my fate was connected with the book which had been last brought;
so, after looking on the packet from my corner for a considerable
time, I got up and went to the table.</p>
<p>The packet was lying where it had been left&mdash;I took it
up; had the envelope, which consisted of whitish brown paper,
been secured by a string or a seal, I should not have opened it,
as I should have considered such an act almost in the light of a
crime; the books, however, had been merely folded up, and I
therefore considered that there could be no possible harm in
inspecting them, more especially as I had received no injunction
to the contrary.&nbsp; Perhaps there was something unsound in
this reasoning, something sophistical; but a child <!-- page
27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>is
sometimes as ready as a grown-up person in finding excuses for
doing that which he is inclined to.&nbsp; But whether the action
was right or wrong, and I am afraid it was not altogether right,
I undid the packet: it contained three books; two from their
similarity seemed to be separate parts of one and the same work;
they were handsomely bound, and to them I first turned my
attention.&nbsp; I opened them successively, and endeavoured to
make out their meaning; their contents, however, as far as I was
able to understand them, were by no means interesting: whoever
pleases may read these books for me, and keep them too, into the
bargain, said I to myself.</p>
<p>I now took up the third book: it did not resemble the others,
being longer and considerably thicker; the binding was of dingy
calf-skin.&nbsp; I opened it, and as I did so another strange
thrill of pleasure shot through my frame.&nbsp; The first object
on which my eyes rested was a picture; it was exceedingly well
executed, at least the scene which it represented made a vivid
impression upon me, which would hardly have been the case had the
artist not been faithful to nature.&nbsp; A wild scene it
was&mdash;a heavy sea and rocky shore, with mountains in the
background, above which the moon was peering.&nbsp; Not far from
the shore, upon the water, was a boat with two figures in it, one
of which stood at the bow, pointing with what I knew to be a gun
at a dreadful shape in the water; fire was flashing from the
muzzle of the gun, and the monster appeared to be
transfixed.&nbsp; I almost thought I heard its cry.&nbsp; I
remained motionless, gazing upon the picture, scarcely daring to
draw my breath, lest the new and wondrous world should <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>vanish of which I had now obtained a glimpse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who are those people, and what could have brought them
into that strange situation?&rdquo; I asked of myself; and now
the seed of curiosity, which had so long lain dormant, began to
expand, and I vowed to myself to become speedily acquainted with
the whole history of the people in the boat.&nbsp; After looking
on the picture till every mark and line in it were familiar to
me, I turned over various leaves till I came to another
engraving; a new source of wonder&mdash;a low sandy beach on
which the furious sea was breaking in mountain-like billows;
cloud and rack deformed the firmament, which wore a dull and
leaden-like hue; gulls and other aquatic fowls were toppling upon
the blast, or skimming over the tops of the maddening
waves&mdash;&ldquo;Mercy upon him! he must be drowned!&rdquo; I
exclaimed, as my eyes fell upon a poor wretch who appeared to be
striving to reach the shore; he was upon his legs, but was
evidently half smothered with the brine; high above his head
curled a horrible billow, as if to engulf him for ever.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He must be drowned! he must be drowned!&rdquo; I almost
shrieked, and dropped the book.&nbsp; I soon snatched it up
again, and now my eye lighted on a third picture: again a shore,
but what a sweet and lovely one, and how I wished to be treading
it!&nbsp; There were beautiful shells lying on the smooth white
sand&mdash;some were empty like those I had occasionally seen on
marble mantelpieces, but out of others peered the heads and
bodies of wondrous crayfish; a wood of thick green trees skirted
the beach and partly shaded it from the rays of the sun, which
shone hot above, while blue waves slightly crested with foam were
gently curling against it; <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>there was a
human figure upon the beach, wild and uncouth, clad in the skins
of animals, with a huge cap on his head, a hatchet at his girdle,
and in his hand a gun; his feet and legs were bare; he stood in
an attitude of horror and surprise; his body was bent far back,
and his eyes, which seemed starting out of his head, were fixed
upon a mark on the sand&mdash;a large distinct mark&mdash;a human
footprint. . . .</p>
<p>Reader, is it necessary to name the book which now stood open
in my hand, and whose very prints, feeble expounders of its
wondrous lines, had produced within me emotions strange and
novel?&nbsp; Scarcely&mdash;for it was a book which has exerted
over the minds of Englishmen an influence certainly greater than
any other of modern times&mdash;which has been in most
people&rsquo;s hands, and with the contents of which even those
who cannot read are to a certain extent acquainted&mdash;a book
from which the most luxuriant and fertile of our modern prose
writers have drunk inspiration&mdash;a book, moreover, to which,
from the hardy deeds which it narrates, and the spirit of strange
and romantic enterprise which it tends to awaken, England owes
many of her astonishing discoveries both by sea and land, and no
inconsiderable part of her naval glory.</p>
<p>Hail to thee, spirit of De Foe!&nbsp; What does not my own
poor self owe to thee?&nbsp; England has better bards than either
Greece or Rome, yet I could spare them easier far than De Foe,
&ldquo;unabashed De Foe,&rdquo; as the hunchbacked rhymer styled
him.</p>
<p>The true chord had now been touched; a raging curiosity with
respect to the contents of the volume, whose engravings had
fascinated my eye, burned within me, and I never rested until I
had fully satisfied it; weeks succeeded weeks, months <!-- page
30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>followed months, and the wondrous volume was my only
study and principal source of amusement.&nbsp; For hours together
I would sit poring over a page till I had become acquainted with
the import of every line.&nbsp; My progress, slow enough at
first, became by degrees more rapid, till at last, under &ldquo;a
shoulder of mutton sail,&rdquo; I found myself cantering before a
steady breeze over an ocean of enchantment, so well pleased with
my voyage that I cared not how long it might be ere it reached
its termination.</p>
<p>And it was in this manner that I first took to the paths of
knowledge.</p>
<p>About this time I began to be somewhat impressed with
religious feelings.&nbsp; My parents were, to a certain extent,
religious people; but, though they had done their best to afford
me instruction on religious points, I had either paid no
attention to what they endeavoured to communicate, or had
listened with an ear far too obtuse to derive any benefit.&nbsp;
But my mind had now become awakened from the drowsy torpor in
which it had lain so long, and the reasoning powers which I
possessed were no longer inactive.&nbsp; Hitherto I had
entertained no conception whatever of the nature and properties
of God, and with the most perfect indifference had heard the
Divine name proceeding from the mouths of
people&mdash;frequently, alas! on occasions when it ought not to
be employed; but I now never heard it without a tremor, for I now
knew that God was an awful and inscrutable being, the maker of
all things; that we were His children, and that we, by our sins,
had justly offended Him; that we were in very great peril from
His anger, not so much in this life as in <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>another and
far stranger state of being yet to come; that we had a Saviour
withal to whom it was necessary to look for help: upon this
point, however, I was yet very much in the dark, as, indeed, were
most of those with whom I was connected.&nbsp; The power and
terrors of God were uppermost in my thoughts; they fascinated
though they astounded me.&nbsp; Twice every Sunday I was
regularly taken to the church, where, from a corner of the large
spacious pew, lined with black leather, I would fix my eyes on
the dignified high-church rector, <a name="citation31a"></a><a
href="#footnote31a" class="citation">[31a]</a> and the dignified
high-church clerk, <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a> and watch the
movement of their lips, from which, as they read their respective
portions of the venerable liturgy, would roll many a portentous
word descriptive of the wondrous works of the Most High.</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou didst divide the sea, through
Thy power: Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Philoh</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou smotest the heads of
Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him to be meat for the people in
the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Rector</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou broughtest out fountains, and
waters out of the hard rocks: Thou driedst up mighty
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Philoh</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The day is Thine, and the night is
Thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peace to your memories, dignified rector, and yet more
dignified clerk!&mdash;by this time ye are probably gone to your
long homes, and your voices <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>are no longer
heard sounding down the aisles of the venerable church&mdash;nay,
doubtless, this has already long since been the fate of him of
the sonorous &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;&mdash;the one of the two who,
with all due respect to the rector, principally engrossed my
boyish admiration&mdash;he, at least, is scarcely now among the
living!&nbsp; Living! why, I have heard say that he blew a
fife&mdash;for he was a musical as well as a Christian
professor&mdash;a bold fife, to cheer the Guards and the brave
Marines as they marched with measured step, obeying an insane
command, up Bunker&rsquo;s height, whilst the rifles of the
sturdy Yankees were sending the leaden hail sharp and thick
amidst the red-coated ranks; for Philoh had not always been a man
of peace, nor an exhorter to turn the other cheek to the smiter,
but had even arrived at the dignity of a halberd in his
country&rsquo;s service before his six-foot form required rest,
and the grey-haired veteran retired, after a long peregrination,
to his native town, to enjoy ease and respectability on a pension
of &ldquo;eighteenpence a day&rdquo;; and well did his
fellow-townsmen act when, to increase that ease and
respectability, and with a thoughtful regard for the dignity of
the good Church service, they made him clerk and
precentor&mdash;the man of the tall form and of the audible
voice, which sounded loud and clear as his own Bunker fife.&nbsp;
Well, peace to thee, thou fine old chap, despiser of dissenters,
and hater of papists, as became a dignified and high-church
clerk; if thou art in thy grave, the better for thee; thou wert
fitted to adorn a bygone time, when loyalty was in vogue, and
smiling content lay like a sunbeam upon the land, but thou
wouldst be sadly out of place in these days of cold philosophic
latitudinarian <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>doctrine, universal tolerism, and
half-concealed rebellion&mdash;rare times, no doubt, for papists
and dissenters, but which would assuredly have broken the heart
of the loyal soldier of George the Third, and the dignified
high-church clerk of pretty D---.</p>
<p>We passed many months at this place: nothing, however,
occurred requiring any particular notice, relating to myself,
beyond what I have already stated, and I am not writing the
history of others.&nbsp; At length <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a> my father was
recalled to his regiment, which at that time was stationed at a
place called Norman Cross, in Lincolnshire, or rather
Huntingdonshire, at some distance from the old town of
Peterborough.&nbsp; For this place he departed, leaving my mother
and myself to follow in a few days.&nbsp; Our journey was a
singular one.&nbsp; On the second day we reached a marshy and
fenny country, which, owing to immense quantities of rain which
had lately fallen, was completely submerged.&nbsp; At a large
town we got on board a kind of passage-boat, crowded with people;
it had neither sails nor oars, and those were not the days of
steam-vessels; it was a treck-schuyt, and was drawn by
horses.</p>
<p>Young as I was, there was much connected with this journey
which highly surprised me, and which brought to my remembrance
particular scenes described in the book which I now generally
carried in my bosom.&nbsp; The country was, as I have already
said, submerged&mdash;entirely drowned&mdash;no land was visible;
the trees were growing bolt upright in the flood, whilst
farmhouses and cottages were standing insulated; the horses which
drew <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>us were up to the knees in water, and, on coming to
blind pools and &ldquo;greedy depths,&rdquo; were not
unfrequently swimming, in which case the boys or urchins who
mounted them sometimes stood, sometimes knelt, upon the saddle
and pillions.&nbsp; No accident, however, occurred either to the
quadrupeds or bipeds, who appeared respectively to be quite <i>au
fait</i> in their business, and extricated themselves with the
greatest ease from places in which Pharaoh and all his hosts
would have gone to the bottom.&nbsp; Night-fall brought us to
Peterborough, and from thence we were not slow in reaching the
place of our destination.</p>

<p>Norman Cross&mdash;Wide Expanse&mdash;Vive
l&rsquo;Empereur&mdash;Unpruned Woods&mdash;Man with the
Bag&mdash;Froth and Conceit&mdash;I beg your Pardon&mdash;Growing
Timid&mdash;About Three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;Taking One&rsquo;s
Ease&mdash;Cheek on the Ground&mdash;King of the
Vipers&mdash;French King&mdash;Frenchmen and Water.</p>
<p>And a strange place it was, this Norman Cross, and, at the
time of which I am speaking, a sad cross to many a Norman, being
what was then styled a French prison, that is, a receptacle for
captives made in the French war.&nbsp; It consisted, if I
remember right, of some five or six casernes, very long, and
immensely high; each standing isolated from the rest, upon a spot
of ground which might average ten acres, and which was fenced
round with lofty palisades, the whole being compassed about by a
towering wall, beneath which, at intervals, on both sides,
sentinels were stationed, whilst outside, upon the field, stood
commodious wooden barracks, capable of containing two regiments
of infantry, intended to serve as guards upon the captives.&nbsp;
Such was the station or prison at Norman Cross, where some six
thousand French and other foreigners, followers of the grand
Corsican, were now immured.</p>
<p>What a strange appearance had those mighty <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>casernes,
with their blank blind walls, without windows or grating, and
their slanting roofs, out of which, through orifices where the
tiles had been removed, would be protruded dozens of grim heads,
feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide expanse of country
unfolded from that airy height.&nbsp; Ah! there was much misery
in those casernes; and from those roofs, doubtless, many a
wistful look was turned in the direction of lovely France.&nbsp;
Much had the poor inmates to endure, and much to complain of, to
the disgrace of England be it said&mdash;of England, in general
so kind and bountiful.&nbsp; Rations of carrion meat, and bread
from which I have seen the very hounds occasionally turn away,
were unworthy entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy, when
helpless and a captive; and such, alas! was the fare in those
casernes.&nbsp; And then, those visits, or rather ruthless
inroads, called in the slang of the place
&ldquo;strawplait-hunts,&rdquo; when in pursuit of a contraband
article, which the prisoners, in order to procure themselves a
few of the necessaries and comforts of existence, were in the
habit of making, red-coated battalions were marched into the
prisons, who, with the bayonet&rsquo;s point, carried havoc and
ruin into every poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had
been endeavouring to raise around it; and then the triumphant
exit with the miserable booty; and, worst of all, the accursed
bonfire, on the barrack parade, of the plait contraband, beneath
the view of the glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs, amidst
the hurrahs of the troops, frequently drowned in the curses
poured down from above like a tempest-shower, or in the terrific
war-whoop of &ldquo;<i>Vive l&rsquo;Empereur</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>It was midsummer when we arrived at this place, and the
weather, which had for a long time been wet and gloomy, now
became bright and glorious; I was subjected to but little
control, and passed my time pleasantly enough, principally in
wandering about the neighbouring country.&nbsp; It was flat and
somewhat fenny, a district more of pasture than agriculture, and
not very thickly inhabited.&nbsp; I soon became well acquainted
with it.&nbsp; At the distance of two miles from the station was
a large lake, styled in the dialect of the country &ldquo;a
mere,&rdquo; <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a> about whose borders tall reeds were
growing in abundance, this was a frequent haunt of mine; but my
favourite place of resort was a wild sequestered spot at a
somewhat greater distance.&nbsp; Here, surrounded with woods and
thick groves, was the seat of some ancient family, deserted by
the proprietor, and only inhabited by a rustic servant or
two.&nbsp; A place more solitary and wild could scarcely be
imagined; the garden and walks were overgrown with weeds and
briars, and the unpruned woods were so tangled as to be almost
impervious.&nbsp; About this domain I would wander till overtaken
by fatigue, and then I would sit down with my back against some
beech, elm, or stately alder tree, and, taking out my book, would
pass hours in a state of unmixed enjoyment, my eyes now fixed on
the wondrous pages, now glancing at the sylvan scene around; and
sometimes I would drop the book and listen to the voice of the
rooks and wild pigeons, and not unfrequently to the croaking of
multitudes of frogs from the neighbouring swamps and fens.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>In going to and from this place I frequently passed a
tall elderly individual, dressed in rather a quaint fashion, with
a skin cap on his head and stout gaiters on his legs; on his
shoulders hung a moderate sized leathern sack; he seemed fond of
loitering near sunny banks, and of groping amidst furze and low
scrubby bramble bushes, of which there were plenty in the
neighbourhood of Norman Cross.&nbsp; Once I saw him standing in
the middle of a dusty road, looking intently at a large mark
which seemed to have been drawn across it, as if by a
walking-stick.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must have been a large one,&rdquo;
the old man muttered half to himself, &ldquo;or he would not have
left such a trail; I wonder if he is near; he seems to have moved
this way.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then went behind some bushes which grew
on the right side of the road, and appeared to be in quest of
something, moving behind the bushes with his head downwards, and
occasionally striking their roots with his foot: at length he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; and forthwith I saw him dart
amongst the bushes.&nbsp; There was a kind of scuffling noise,
the rustling of branches, and the crackling of dry sticks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have him!&rdquo; said the man at last; &ldquo;I have got
him!&rdquo; and presently he made his appearance about twenty
yards down the road, holding a large viper in his hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you think of that, my boy?&rdquo; said he, as I
went up to him&mdash;&ldquo;what do you think of catching such a
thing as that with the naked hand?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do I
think?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, that I could do as much
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;do you?&nbsp; Lord! how the young people in these days are
given to conceit; it did not use to be so in my time: when I was
a child, childer knew how to behave themselves; <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>but the
childer of these days are full of conceit, full of froth, like
the mouth of this viper;&rdquo; and with his forefinger and thumb
he squeezed a considerable quantity of foam from the jaws of the
viper down upon the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;The childer of these days
are a generation of&mdash;God forgive me, what was I about to
say?&rdquo; said the old man; and opening his bag he thrust the
reptile into it, which appeared far from empty.&nbsp; I passed
on.&nbsp; As I was returning, towards the evening, I overtook the
old man, who was wending in the same direction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
evening to you, sir,&rdquo; said I, taking off a cap which I wore
on my head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said the old man;
and then, looking at me, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, sure, the child I met in the
morning?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am;
what makes you doubt it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, you were then
all froth and conceit,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and now
you take off your cap to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your
pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I was frothy and conceited; it
ill becomes a child like me to be so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, dear,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;well, as you have begged my pardon, I truly forgive
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have
you caught any more of those things?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Only
four or five,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;they are getting
scarce, though this used to be a great neighbourhood for
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what do you do with them?&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;do you carry them home and play with
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I sometimes play with one or two that I
tame,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;but I hunt them mostly for
the fat which they contain, out of which I make unguents which
are good for various sore troubles, especially for the
rheumatism.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you get your living by
hunting these creatures?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not <!--
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>altogether,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;besides
being a viper-hunter, I am what they call a herbalist, one who
knows the virtue of particular herbs; I gather them at the proper
season, to make medicines with for the sick.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And do you live in the neighbourhood?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem very fond of asking questions,
child.&nbsp; No, I do not live in this neighbourhood in
particular, I travel about; I have not been in this neighbourhood
till lately for some years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time the old man and myself formed an acquaintance;
I often accompanied him in his wanderings about the
neighbourhood, and, on two or three occasions, assisted him in
catching the reptiles which he hunted.&nbsp; He generally carried
a viper with him which he had made quite tame, and from which he
had extracted the poisonous fangs; it would dance and perform
various kinds of tricks.&nbsp; He was fond of telling me
anecdotes connected with his adventures with the reptile
species.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he one day, sighing,
&ldquo;I must shortly give up this business; I am no longer the
man I was; I am become timid, and when a person is timid in
viper-hunting, he had better leave off, as it is quite clear his
virtue is leaving him.&nbsp; I got a fright some years ago, which
I am quite sure I shall never get the better of; my hand has been
shaky more or less ever since.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What
frightened you?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had better not tell
you,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;or you may be frightened
too, lose your virtue, and be no longer good for the
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to follow the business: I daresay I
shall be an officer, like my father.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I once saw the king
of the vipers, and since then&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The king
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>of the vipers!&rdquo; said I, interrupting him;
&ldquo;have the vipers a king?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As sure as we
have,&rdquo; said the old man&mdash;&ldquo;as sure as we have
King George to rule over us, have these reptiles a king to rule
over them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And where did you see him?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t like talking about the matter.&nbsp;
It may be about seven years ago that I happened to be far down
yonder to the west, on the other side of England, nearly two
hundred miles from here, following my business.&nbsp; It was a
very sultry day, I remember, and I had been out several hours
catching creatures.&nbsp; It might be about three o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon, when I found myself on some heathy land near
the sea, on the ridge of a hill, the side of which, nearly as far
down as the sea, was heath; but on the top there was arable
ground, which had been planted, and from which the harvest had
been gathered&mdash;oats or barley, I know not which&mdash;but I
remember that the ground was covered with stubble.&nbsp; Well,
about three o&rsquo;clock, as I told you before, what with the
heat of the day and from having walked about for hours in a lazy
way, I felt very tired; so I determined to have a sleep, and I
laid myself down, my head just on the ridge of the hill, towards
the field, and my body over the side down amongst the heath; my
bag, which was nearly filled with creatures, lay at a little
distance from my face; the creatures were struggling in it, I
remember, and I thought to myself, how much more comfortably off
I was than they; I was taking my ease on the nice open hill,
cooled with the breezes, whilst they were in the nasty close bag,
coiling about one another, and breaking their very hearts, all to
no purpose: and I felt quite comfortable <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and happy in
the thought, and little by little closed my eyes, and fell into
the sweetest snooze that ever I was in in all my life; and there
I lay over the hill&rsquo;s side, with my head half in the field,
I don&rsquo;t know how long, all dead asleep.&nbsp; At last it
seemed to me that I heard a noise in my sleep, something like a
thing moving, very faint, however, far away; then it died, and
then it came again upon my ear as I slept, and now it appeared
almost as if I heard crackle, crackle; then it died again, or I
became yet more dead asleep than before, I know not which, but I
certainly lay some time without hearing it.&nbsp; All of a sudden
I became awake, and there was I, on the ridge of the hill, with
my cheek on the ground towards the stubble, with a noise in my
ear like that of something moving towards me, amongst the stubble
of the field; well, I lay a moment or two listening to the noise,
and then I became frightened, for I did not like the noise at
all, it sounded so odd; so I rolled myself on my belly, and
looked towards the stubble.&nbsp; Mercy upon us! there was a huge
snake, or rather a dreadful viper, for it was all yellow and
gold, moving towards me, bearing its head about a foot and a half
above the ground, the dry stubble crackling beneath its
outrageous belly.&nbsp; It might be about five yards off when I
first saw it, making straight towards me, child, as if it would
devour me.&nbsp; I lay quite still, for I was stupefied with
horror, whilst the creature came still nearer; and now it was
nearly upon me, when it suddenly drew back a little, and
then&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;it lifted its head and chest
high in the air, and high over my face as I looked up, flickering
at me with its tongue as if it would fly at my face.&nbsp; Child,
what I felt at that moment <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>I can
scarcely say, but it was a sufficient punishment for all the sins
I ever committed; and there we two were, I looking up at the
viper, and the viper looking down upon me, flickering at me with
its tongue.&nbsp; It was only the kindness of God that saved me:
all at once there was a loud noise, the report of a gun, for a
fowler was shooting at a covey of birds, a little way off in the
stubble.&nbsp; Whereupon the viper sunk its head, and immediately
made off over the ridge of the hill, down in the direction of the
sea.&nbsp; As it passed by me, however,&mdash;and it passed close
by me,&mdash;it hesitated a moment, as if it was doubtful whether
it should not seize me; it did not, however, but made off down
the hill.&nbsp; It has often struck me that he was angry with me,
and came upon me unawares for presuming to meddle with his
people, as I have always been in the habit of doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how do you know that it was
the king of the vipers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know!&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;who else
should it be?&nbsp; There was as much difference between it and
other reptiles as between King George and other
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is King George, then, different from other
people?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I have never
seen him myself, but I have heard people say that he is a ten
times greater man than other folks; indeed, it stands to reason
that he must be different from the rest, else people would not be
so eager to see him.&nbsp; Do you think, child, that people would
be fools enough to run a matter of twenty or thirty miles to see
the king, provided King George&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the French a king?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;or something
much the same, and a queer one he is; not quite so big as King
George, they say, but quite as terrible a fellow.&nbsp; What of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he should come to Norman Cross!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should he do at Norman Cross, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you were talking about the vipers in your bag
breaking their hearts, and so on, and their king coming to help
them.&nbsp; Now, suppose the French king should hear of his
people being in trouble at Norman Cross, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t come, child,&rdquo; said the old man,
rubbing his hands, &ldquo;the water lies between.&nbsp; The
French don&rsquo;t like the water; neither vipers nor Frenchmen
take kindly to the water, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the old man <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a> left the country,
which he did a few days after the conversation which I have just
related, he left me the reptile which he had tamed and rendered
quite harmless by removing the fangs.&nbsp; I was in the habit of
feeding it with milk, and frequently carried it abroad with me in
my walks.</p>

<p>One day it happened that, being on my rambles, I entered a
green lane which I had never seen before; at first it was rather
narrow, but as I advanced it became considerably wider; in the
middle was a drift-way with deep ruts, but right and left was a
space carpeted with a sward of trefoil and clover; there was no
lack of trees, chiefly ancient oaks, which, flinging out their
arms from either side, nearly formed a canopy, and afforded a
pleasing shelter from the rays of the sun, which was burning
fiercely above.&nbsp; Suddenly a group of objects attracted my
attention.&nbsp; Beneath one of the largest of the trees, upon
the grass, was a kind of low tent or booth, from the top of which
a thin smoke was curling; beside it stood a couple of light
carts, whilst two or three lean horses or ponies were cropping
the herbage which was growing nigh.&nbsp; Wondering to whom this
odd tent could belong, I advanced till I was close before it,
when <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>I found that it consisted of two tilts, like those of
waggons, placed upon the ground and fronting each other,
connected behind by a sail or large piece of canvas which was but
partially drawn across the top; upon the ground, in the
intervening space, was a fire, over which, supported by a kind of
iron crowbar, hung a caldron; my advance had been so noiseless as
not to alarm the inmates, who consisted of a man and woman, who
sat apart, one on each side of the fire; they were both busily
employed&mdash;the man was carding plaited straw, whilst the
woman seemed to be rubbing something with a white powder, some of
which lay on a plate beside her; suddenly the man looked up, and,
perceiving me, uttered a strange kind of cry, and the next moment
both the woman and himself were on their feet and rushing out
upon me.</p>
<p>I retreated a few steps, yet without turning to flee.&nbsp; I
was not, however, without apprehension, which, indeed, the
appearance of these two people was well calculated to inspire:
the woman was a stout figure, seemingly between thirty and forty;
she wore no cap, and her long hair fell on either side of her
head like horse-tails half way down her waist; her skin was dark
and swarthy, like that of a toad, and the expression of her
countenance was particularly evil; her arms were bare, and her
bosom was but half concealed by a slight bodice, below which she
wore a coarse petticoat, her only other article of dress.&nbsp;
The man was somewhat younger, but of a figure equally wild; his
frame was long and lathy, but his arms were remarkably short, his
neck was rather bent, he squinted slightly, and his mouth was
much awry; his complexion was dark, but, unlike that of the
woman, was <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>more ruddy than livid; there was a
deep scar on his cheek, something like the impression of a
halfpenny.&nbsp; The dress was quite in keeping with the figure:
in his hat, which was slightly peaked, was stuck a
peacock&rsquo;s feather; over a waistcoat of hide, untanned and
with the hair upon it, he wore a rough jerkin of russet hue;
smallclothes of leather, which had probably once belonged to a
soldier, but with which pipeclay did not seem to have come in
contact for many a year, protected his lower man as far as the
knee; his legs were cased in long stockings of blue worsted, and
on his shoes he wore immense old-fashioned buckles.</p>
<p>Such were the two beings who now came rushing upon me; the man
was rather in advance, brandishing a ladle in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have caught you at last,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach ye, you young highwayman, to come
skulking about my properties!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young as I was, I remarked that his manner of speaking was
different from that of any people with whom I had been in the
habit of associating.&nbsp; It was quite as strange as his
appearance, and yet it nothing resembled the foreign English
which I had been in the habit of hearing through the palisades of
the prison; he could scarcely be a foreigner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your properties!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am in the
King&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; Why did you put them there, if you did
not wish them to be seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the spy,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;hey?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll drown him in the sludge in the toad-pond over the
hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we will,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;drown him anon
in the mud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drown me, will you?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I should <!--
page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>like to see you!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all this
about?&nbsp; Was it because I saw you with your hands full of
straw plait, and my mother there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;what was I
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How should I know?&nbsp; Making bad
money, perhaps!</p>
<p>And it will be as well here to observe, that at this time
there was much bad money in circulation in the neighbourhood,
generally supposed to be fabricated by the prisoners, so that
this false coin and straw plait formed the standard subjects of
conversation at Norman Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strangle thee,&rdquo; said the beldame,
dashing at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bad money, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me, wifelkin,&rdquo; said the man,
interposing; &ldquo;you shall now see how I&rsquo;ll baste him
down the lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I tell you what, my chap, you had better
put down that thing of yours; my father lies concealed within my
tepid breast, and if to me you offer any harm or wrong,
I&rsquo;ll call him forth to help me with his forked tongue.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; What do you mean, ye Bengui&rsquo;s <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> bantling?&nbsp; I never heard such
discourse in all my life: play man&rsquo;s speech or
Frenchman&rsquo;s talk&mdash;which, I wonder?&nbsp; Your father!
tell the mumping villain that if he comes near my fire I&rsquo;ll
serve him out as I will you.&nbsp; Take that . . . Tiny Jesus!
what have we got here?&nbsp; Oh, delicate Jesus! what is the
matter with the child?</p>
<p>I had made a motion which the viper understood; and now,
partly disengaging itself from my bosom, where it had lain perdu,
it raised its head to a level <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>with my face,
and stared upon my enemy with its glittering eyes.</p>
<p>The man stood like one transfixed, and the ladle, with which
he had aimed a blow at me, now hung in the air like the hand
which held it; his mouth was extended, and his cheeks became of a
pale yellow, save alone that place which bore the mark which I
have already described, and this shone now portentously, like
fire.&nbsp; He stood in this manner for some time; at last the
ladle fell from his hand, and its falling appeared to rouse him
from his stupor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, wifelkin,&rdquo; said he, in a faltering tone,
&ldquo;did you ever see the like of this here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the woman had retreated to the tent, from the entrance of
which her loathly face was now thrust, with an expression partly
of terror and partly of curiosity.&nbsp; After gazing some time
longer at the viper and myself, the man stooped down and took up
the ladle; then, as if somewhat more assured, he moved to the
tent, where he entered into conversation with the beldame in a
low voice.&nbsp; Of their discourse, though I could hear the
greater part of it, I understood not a single word; and I
wondered what it could be, for I knew by the sound that it was
not French.&nbsp; At last the man, in a somewhat louder tone,
appeared to put a question to the woman, who nodded her head
affirmatively, and in a moment or two produced a small stool,
which she delivered to him.&nbsp; He placed it on the ground,
close by the door of the tent, first rubbing it with his sleeve,
as if for the purpose of polishing its surface.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Now, my precious little gentleman, do sit
down here by the poor people&rsquo;s tent; we wish to <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>be
civil in our slight way.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be angry, and say no;
but look kindly upon us, and satisfied, my precious little God
Almighty.</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; Yes, my gorgeous angel, sit down by the
poor bodies&rsquo; fire, and eat a sweetmeat.&nbsp; We want to
ask you a question or two; only first put that serpent away.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I can sit down, and bid the serpent go to
sleep, that&rsquo;s easy enough; but as for eating a sweetmeat,
how can I do that?&nbsp; I have not got one, and where am I to
get it?</p>
<p><i>Woman</i>.&nbsp; Never fear, my tiny tawny, <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a> we can give you one, such as you never
ate, I daresay, however far you may have come from.</p>
<p>The serpent sunk into its usual resting-place, and I sat down
on the stool.&nbsp; The woman opened a box, and took out a
strange little basket or hamper, not much larger than a
man&rsquo;s fist, and formed of a delicate kind of matting.&nbsp;
It was sewed at the top; but, ripping it open with a knife, she
held it to me, and I saw, to my surprise, that it contained
candied fruits of a dark green hue, tempting enough to one of my
age.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, my tiny,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;taste,
and tell me how you like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where did you get
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beldame leered upon me for a moment, then, nodding her
head thrice, with a knowing look, said, &ldquo;Who knows better
than yourself, my tawny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I knew nothing about the matter; but I saw that these
strange people had conceived a very <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>high opinion
of the abilities of their visitor, which I was nothing loath to
encourage.&nbsp; I therefore answered boldly, &ldquo;Ah! who
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;who should know
better than yourself, or so well?&nbsp; And now, my tiny one, let
me ask you one thing&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t come to do us any
harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I had no dislike to you;
though, if you were to meddle with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Of course, my gorgeous, of course you would;
and quite right too.&nbsp; Meddle with you!&mdash;what right have
we?&nbsp; I should say, it would not be quite safe.&nbsp; I see
how it is; you are one of them there;&mdash;and he bent his head
towards his left shoulder.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I am one of them&mdash;for I thought
he was alluding to the soldiers,&mdash;you had best mind what you
are about, I can tell you.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t doubt we will for our own sake;
Lord bless you, wifelkin, only think that we should see one of
them there when we least thought about it.&nbsp; Well, I have
heard of such things, though I never thought to see one; however,
seeing is believing.&nbsp; Well! now you are come, and are not
going to do us any mischief, I hope you will stay; you can do us
plenty of good if you will.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What good could I do you?</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; What good? plenty!&nbsp; Would you not bring
us luck?&nbsp; I have heard say, that one of them there always
does, if it will but settle down.&nbsp; Stay with us; you shall
have a tilted cart all to yourself if you like.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
make you our little God Almighty, and say our prayers to you
every morning!</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; That would be nice; and, if you
were to give me plenty of these things, I should have no
objection.&nbsp; But what would my father say?&nbsp; I think he
would hardly let me.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Why not? he would be with you; and kindly
would we treat him.&nbsp; Indeed, without your father you would
be nothing at all.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true; but I do not think he
could be spared from his regiment.&nbsp; I have heard him say
that they could do nothing without him.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; His regiment!&nbsp; What are you talking
about?&mdash;what does the child mean?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What do I mean!&mdash;why, that my father
is an officer-man at the barracks yonder, keeping guard over the
French prisoners.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Oh! then that sap <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> is not your father?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What, the snake?&nbsp; Why, no!&nbsp; Did
you think he was?</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; To be sure we did.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you
tell me so?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why, yes; but who would have thought you
would have believed it?&nbsp; It is a tame one.&nbsp; I hunt
vipers, and tame them.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; O&mdash;h!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;h!&rdquo; grunted the woman,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man and woman, who during this conversation had resumed
their former positions within the tent, looked at each other with
a queer look of surprise, as if somewhat disconcerted at what
they now heard.&nbsp; They then entered into discourse with each
other in the same strange tongue which had already puzzled
me.&nbsp; At length the man looked me in the face, and said,
somewhat <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>hesitatingly, &ldquo;So you are not
one of them there after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; One of them there?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Why, we have been thinking you were a
goblin&mdash;a devilkin!&nbsp; However, I see how it is: you are
a sap-engro, a chap who catches snakes, and plays tricks with
them!&nbsp; Well, it comes very nearly to the same thing; and if
you please to list with us, and bear us pleasant company, we
shall be glad of you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d take my oath upon it, that
we might make a mort of money by you and that sap, and the tricks
it could do; and, as you seem fly to everything, I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you would make a prime hand at telling
fortunes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><i>Man</i>.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; And you might still be our
God Almighty, or at any rate our clergyman, so you should live in
a tilted cart by yourself, and say prayers to us night and
morning&mdash;to wifelkin here, and all our family; there&rsquo;s
plenty of us when we are all together: as I said before, you seem
fly, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you could read?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I can read;&rdquo; and,
eager to display my accomplishments, I took my book out of my
pocket, and, opening it at random, proceeded to read how a
certain man, whilst wandering about a certain solitary island,
entered a cave, the mouth of which was overgrown with brushwood,
and how he was nearly frightened to death in that cave by
something which he saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the kind of prayers for me and my family, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
they, wifelkin?&nbsp; I never heard more delicate prayers in <!--
page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>all my life!&nbsp; Why, they beat the rubricals
hollow!&mdash;and here comes my son Jasper.&nbsp; I say, Jasper,
here&rsquo;s a young sap-engro that can read, and is more fly
than yourself.&nbsp; Shake hands with him; I wish ye to be two
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swift but stealthy pace Jasper came towards us from the
farther part of the lane; on reaching the tent he stood still,
and looked fixedly upon me as I sat upon the stool; I looked
fixedly upon him.&nbsp; A queer look had Jasper; he was a lad of
some twelve or thirteen years, with long arms, unlike the
singular being who called himself his father; his complexion was
ruddy, but his face was seamed, though it did not bear the
peculiar scar which disfigured the countenance of the other; nor,
though roguish enough, a certain evil expression which that of
the other bore, and which the face of the woman possessed in a
yet more remarkable degree.&nbsp; For the rest, he wore drab
breeches, with certain strings at the knee, a rather gay
waistcoat, and tolerably white shirt; under his arm he bore a
mighty whip of whalebone with a brass knob, and upon his head was
a hat without either top or brim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Jasper! shake hands with the
sap-engro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he box, father?&rdquo; said Jasper, surveying me
rather contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should think not, he looks
so puny and small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your peace, fool!&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;he
can do more than that&mdash;I tell you he&rsquo;s fly: he carries
a sap about, which would sting a ninny like you to
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, a sap-engro!&rdquo; said the boy, with a singular
whine, and, stooping down, he leered <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>curiously in
my face, kindly, however, and then patted me on the head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A sap-engro!&rdquo; he ejaculated; &ldquo;lor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and one of the right sort,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;I am glad we have met with him; he is going to list with
us, and be our clergyman and God Almighty, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
you, my tawny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I must see
what my father will say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father; bah! . . .&rdquo; but here he stopped, for
a sound was heard like the rapid galloping of a horse, not loud
and distinct as on a road, but dull and heavy as if upon a grass
sward; nearer and nearer it came, and the man, starting up,
rushed out of the tent, and looked around anxiously.&nbsp; I
arose from the stool upon which I had been seated, and just at
that moment, amidst a crashing of boughs and sticks, a man on
horseback bounded over the hedge into the lane at a few
yards&rsquo; distance from where we were: from the impetus of the
leap the horse was nearly down on his knees; the rider, however,
by dint of vigorous handling of the reins, prevented him from
falling, and then rode up to the tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
Nat,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;what brings him
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; The new comer was a stout burly fellow, about
the middle age; he had a savage determined look, and his face was
nearly covered over with carbuncles; he wore a broad slouching
hat, and was dressed in a grey coat, cut in a fashion which I
afterwards learnt to be the genuine Newmarket cut, the skirts
being exceedingly short; his waistcoat was of red plush, and he
wore broad corduroy breeches and white top-boots.&nbsp; The steed
which carried him was of iron grey, spirited and powerful, but
covered with <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>sweat and foam.&nbsp; The fellow
glanced fiercely and suspiciously around, and said something to
the man of the tent in a harsh and rapid voice.&nbsp; A short and
hurried conversation ensued in the strange tongue.&nbsp; I could
not take my eyes off this new comer.&nbsp; Oh, that half-jockey,
half-bruiser countenance, I never forgot it!&nbsp; More than
fifteen years afterwards I found myself amidst a crowd before
Newgate; a gallows was erected, and beneath it stood a criminal,
a notorious malefactor.&nbsp; I recognised him at once; the
horseman of the lane is now beneath the fatal tree, but nothing
altered; still the same man; jerking his head to the right and
left with the same fierce and under glance, just as if the
affairs of this world had the same kind of interest to the last;
grey coat of Newmarket cut, plush waistcoat, corduroys, and
boots, nothing altered; but the head, alas! is bare, and so is
the neck.&nbsp; Oh, crime and virtue, virtue and crime!&mdash;it
was old John Newton, I think, who, when he saw a man going to be
hanged, said, &ldquo;There goes John Newton, but for the grace of
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the lane, the lane, all was now in confusion in the lane;
the man and woman were employed in striking the tents and in
making hurried preparations for departure; the boy Jasper was
putting the harness upon the ponies and attaching them to the
carts; and, to increase the singularity of the scene, two or
three wild-looking women and girls, in red cloaks and immense
black beaver bonnets, came from I know not what direction, and,
after exchanging a few words with the others, commenced with
fierce and agitated gestures to assist them in their
occupation.&nbsp; The rider meanwhile <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>sat upon his
horse, but evidently in a state of great impatience; he muttered
curses between his teeth, spurred the animal furiously, and then
reined it in, causing it to rear itself up nearly
perpendicular.&nbsp; At last he said, &ldquo;Curse ye, for
Romans, how slow ye are! well, it is no business of mine, stay
here all day if you like; I have given ye warning, I am off to
the big north road.&nbsp; However, before I go, you had better
give me all you have of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly spoken, Nat, my pal,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;give it him, mother.&nbsp; There it is; now be off as soon
as you please, and rid us of evil company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman had handed him two bags formed of stocking, half
full of something heavy, which looked through them for all the
world like money of some kind.&nbsp; The fellow, on receiving
them, thrust them without ceremony into the pockets of his coat,
and then, without a word of farewell salutation, departed at a
tremendous rate, the hoofs of his horse thundering for a long
time on the hard soil of the neighbouring road, till the sound
finally died away in the distance.&nbsp; The strange people were
not slow in completing their preparations, and then, flogging
their animals terrifically, hurried away seemingly in the same
direction.</p>
<p>The boy Jasper was last of the band.&nbsp; As he was following
the rest, he stopped suddenly, and looked on the ground appearing
to muse; then, turning round, he came up to me where I was
standing, leered in my face, and then, thrusting out his hand, he
said, &ldquo;Good bye, Sap; I daresay we shall meet again;
remember we are brothers; two gentle brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Then whining forth, &ldquo;What, a sap-engro,
lor!&rdquo; he gave me a parting leer, and hastened away.</p>
<p>I remained standing in the lane gazing after the retreating
company.&nbsp; &ldquo;A strange set of people,&rdquo; said I at
last; &ldquo;I wonder who they can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three Years&mdash;Lilly&rsquo;s

School Bell&mdash;Order of
Succession&mdash;Persecution&mdash;What are we to
do?&mdash;Northward&mdash;A Goodly Scene&mdash;Haunted
Ground&mdash;Feats of Chivalry&mdash;Rivers&mdash;Over the
Brig.</p>
<p>Years passed on, even three years; during this period I had
increased considerably in stature and in strength, and, let us
hope, improved in mind; for I had entered on the study of the
Latin language.&nbsp; The very first person to whose care I was
entrusted for the acquisition of Latin was an old friend of my
father&rsquo;s, a clergyman who kept a seminary at a town the
very next we visited after our departure from &ldquo;the
Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under his instruction, however, I continued
only a few weeks, as we speedily left the place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said this divine, when my father came to
take leave of him on the eve of our departure, &ldquo;I have a
friendship for you, and therefore wish to give you a piece of
advice concerning this son of yours.&nbsp; You are now removing
him from my care; you do wrong, but we will let that pass.&nbsp;
Listen to me: there is but one good school book in the
world&mdash;the one I use in my seminary&mdash;Lilly&rsquo;s
Latin Grammar, in which your son has already made some
progress.&nbsp; <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>If you are anxious for the success of
your son in life, for the correctness of his conduct and the
soundness of his principles, keep him to Lilly&rsquo;s
Grammar.&nbsp; If you can by any means, either fair or foul,
induce him to get by heart Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar, you may
set your heart at rest with respect to him; I, myself, will be
his warrant.&nbsp; I never yet knew a boy that was induced,
either by fair means or foul, to learn Lilly&rsquo;s Latin
Grammar by heart, who did not turn out a man, provided he lived
long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father, who did not understand the classical languages,
received with respect the advice of his old friend, and from that
moment conceived the highest opinion of Lilly&rsquo;s Latin
Grammar.&nbsp; During three years I studied Lilly&rsquo;s Latin
Grammar under the tuition of various schoolmasters, for I
travelled with the regiment, and in every town in which we were
stationary I was invariably (God bless my father!) sent to the
classical academy of the place.&nbsp; It chanced, by good
fortune, that in the generality of these schools the grammar of
Lilly was in use; when, however, that was not the case, it made
no difference in my educational course, my father always
stipulating with the masters that I should be daily examined in
Lilly.&nbsp; At the end of the three years I had the whole by
heart; you had only to repeat the first two or three words of any
sentence in any part of the book, and forthwith I would open cry,
commencing without blundering and hesitation, and continue till
you were glad to beg me to leave off, with many expressions of
admiration at my proficiency in the Latin language.&nbsp;
Sometimes, however, to convince you how well I merited these
encomiums, I would <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>follow you to the bottom of the
stair, and even into the street, repeating in a kind of sing-song
measure the sonorous lines of the golden schoolmaster.&nbsp; If I
am here asked whether I understood anything of what I had got by
heart, I reply&mdash;&ldquo;Never mind, I understand it all now,
and believe that no one ever yet got Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar
by heart when young, who repented of the feat at a mature
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, when my father saw that I had accomplished my task, he
opened his mouth, and said, &ldquo;Truly, this is more than I
expected.&nbsp; I did not think that there had been so much in
you, either of application or capacity; you have now learnt all
that is necessary, if my friend Dr. B---&rsquo;s opinion was
sterling, as I have no doubt it was.&nbsp; You are still a child,
however, and must yet go to school, in order that you may be kept
out of evil company.&nbsp; Perhaps you may still contrive, now
you have exhausted the barn, to pick up a grain or two in the
barn-yard.&nbsp; You are still ignorant of figures, I believe,
not that I would mention figures in the same day with
Lilly&rsquo;s Grammar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were uttered in a place called ---, in the north,
or in the road to the north, to which, for some time past, our
corps had been slowly advancing.&nbsp; I was sent to the school
of the place, which chanced to be a day school.&nbsp; It was a
somewhat extraordinary one, and a somewhat extraordinary event
occurred to me within its walls.</p>
<p>It occupied part of the farther end of a small plain, or
square, at the outskirts of the town, close to some extensive
bleaching fields.&nbsp; It was a long low building of one room,
with no upper storey; on the top was a kind of wooden box, or
sconce, which <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>I at first mistook for a
pigeon-house, but which in reality contained a bell, to which was
attached a rope, which, passing through the ceiling, hung
dangling in the middle of the school-room.&nbsp; I am the more
particular in mentioning this appurtenance, as I had soon
occasion to scrape acquaintance with it in a manner not very
agreeable to my feelings.&nbsp; The master was very proud of his
bell, if I might judge from the fact of his eyes being frequently
turned to that part of the ceiling from which the rope
depended.&nbsp; Twice every day, namely, after the morning and
evening tasks had been gone through, were the boys rung out of
school by the monotonous jingle of this bell.&nbsp; This ringing
out was rather a lengthy affair, for, as the master was a man of
order and method, the boys were only permitted to go out of the
room one by one; and as they were rather numerous, amounting, at
least, to one hundred, and were taught to move at a pace of
suitable decorum, at least a quarter of an hour elapsed from the
commencement of the march before the last boy could make his
exit.&nbsp; The office of bell-ringer was performed by every boy
successively; and it so happened that, the very first day of my
attendance at the school, the turn to ring the bell had, by order
of succession, arrived at the place which had been allotted to
me; for the master, as I have already observed, was a man of
method and order, and every boy had a particular seat, to which
he became a fixture as long as he continued at the school.</p>
<p>So, upon this day, when the tasks were done and completed, and
the boys sat with their hats and caps in their hands, anxiously
expecting the moment of dismissal, it was suddenly notified to
me, by the <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>urchins who sat nearest to me, that I
must get up and ring the bell.&nbsp; Now, as this was the first
time that I had been at the school, I was totally unacquainted
with the process, which I had never seen, and, indeed, had never
heard of till that moment.&nbsp; I therefore sat still, not
imagining it possible that any such duty could be required of
me.&nbsp; But now, with not a little confusion, I perceived that
the eyes of all the boys in the school were fixed upon me.&nbsp;
Presently there were nods and winks in the direction of the
bell-rope; and, as these produced no effect, uncouth visages were
made, like those of monkeys when enraged; teeth were gnashed,
tongues thrust out, and even fists were bent at me.&nbsp; The
master, who stood at the end of the room, with a huge ferule
under his arm, bent full upon me a look of stern appeal; and the
ushers, of whom there were four, glared upon me, each from his
own particular corner, as I vainly turned, in one direction and
another, in search of one reassuring look.</p>
<p>But now, probably in obedience to a sign from the master, the
boys in my immediate neighbourhood began to maltreat me.&nbsp;
Some pinched me with their fingers, some buffeted me, whilst
others pricked me with pins, or the points of compasses.&nbsp;
These arguments were not without effect.&nbsp; I sprang from my
seat, and endeavoured to escape along a double line of benches,
thronged with boys of all ages, from the urchin of six or seven,
to the nondescript of sixteen or seventeen.&nbsp; It was like
running the gauntlet; every one, great or small, pinching,
kicking, or otherwise maltreating me, as I passed by.</p>
<p>Goaded on in this manner, I at length reached the middle of
the room, where dangled the bell-rope, <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the cause of
all my sufferings.&nbsp; I should have passed it&mdash;for my
confusion was so great, that I was quite at a loss to comprehend
what all this could mean, and almost believed myself under the
influence of an ugly dream&mdash;but now the boys, who were
seated in advance in the row, arose with one accord, and barred
my farther progress; and one, doubtless more sensible than the
rest, seizing the rope, thrust it into my hand.&nbsp; I now began
to perceive that the dismissal of the school, and my own release
from torment, depended upon this selfsame rope.&nbsp; I
therefore, in a fit of desperation, pulled it once or twice, and
then left off, naturally supposing that I had done quite
enough.&nbsp; The boys who sat next the door, no sooner heard the
bell, than rising from their seats, they moved out at the
door.&nbsp; The bell, however, had no sooner ceased to jingle,
than they stopped short, and, turning round, stared at the
master, as much as to say, &ldquo;What are we to do
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was too much for the patience of the man
of method, which my previous stupidity had already nearly
exhausted.&nbsp; Dashing forward into the middle of the room, he
struck me violently on the shoulders with his ferule, and,
snatching the rope out of my hand, exclaimed, with a stentorian
voice, and genuine Yorkshire accent, &ldquo;Prodigy of ignorance!
dost not even know how to ring a bell?&nbsp; Must I myself
instruct thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; He then commenced pulling at the bell
with such violence, that long before half the school was
dismissed the rope broke, and the rest of the boys had to depart
without their accustomed music.</p>
<p>But I must not linger here, though I could say much about the
school and the pedagogue highly amusing and diverting, which,
however, I suppress, <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>in order to make way for matters of
yet greater interest.&nbsp; On we went, northward, northward!
and, as we advanced, I saw that the country was becoming widely
different from those parts of merry England in which we had
previously travelled.&nbsp; It was wilder, and less cultivated,
and more broken with hills and hillocks.&nbsp; The people, too,
of those regions appeared to partake of something of the
character of their country.&nbsp; They were coarsely dressed;
tall and sturdy of frame; their voices were deep and guttural;
and the half of the dialect which they spoke was unintelligible
to my ears.</p>
<p>I often wondered where we could be going, for I was at this
time about as ignorant of geography as I was of most other
things.&nbsp; However, I held my peace, asked no questions, and
patiently awaited the issue.</p>
<p>Northward, northward, still!&nbsp; And it came to pass that,
one morning, I found myself extended on the bank of a
river.&nbsp; It was a beautiful morning of early spring; small
white clouds were floating in the heaven, occasionally veiling
the countenance of the sun, whose light, as they retired, would
again burst forth, coursing like a race-horse over the
scene&mdash;and a goodly scene it was!&nbsp; Before me, across
the water, on an eminence, stood a white old city, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> surrounded with lofty walls, above
which rose the tops of tall houses, with here and there a church
or steeple.&nbsp; To my right hand was a long and massive bridge,
with many arches, and of antique architecture, which traversed
the river.&nbsp; The river was a noble one; the broadest that I
had hitherto seen.&nbsp; Its waters, of a greenish tinge, <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>poured with impetuosity beneath the narrow arches to
meet the sea, close at hand, as the boom of the billows breaking
distinctly upon a beach declared.&nbsp; There were songs upon the
river from the fisher-barks; and occasionally a chorus, plaintive
and wild, such as I had never heard before, the words of which I
did not understand, but which, at the present time, down the long
avenue of years, seem in memory&rsquo;s ear to sound like
&ldquo;Horam, coram, dago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several robust fellows
were near me, some knee-deep in water, employed in hauling the
seine upon the strand.&nbsp; Huge fish were struggling amidst the
meshes&mdash;princely salmon&mdash;their brilliant mail of blue
and silver flashing in the morning beam; so goodly and gay a
scene, in truth, had never greeted my boyish eye.</p>
<p>And, as I gazed upon the prospect, my bosom began to heave,
and my tears to trickle.&nbsp; Was it the beauty of the scene
which gave rise to these emotions?&nbsp; Possibly; for though a
poor ignorant child&mdash;a half-wild creature&mdash;I was not
insensible to the loveliness of nature, and took pleasure in the
happiness and handiworks of my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Yet,
perhaps, in something more deep and mysterious the feelings which
then pervaded me might originate.&nbsp; Who can lie down on Elvir
Hill without experiencing something of the sorcery of the
place?&nbsp; Flee from Elvir Hill, young swain, or the maids of
Elle will have power over you, and you will go elf-wild!&mdash;so
say the Danes.&nbsp; I had unconsciously laid myself down upon
haunted ground; and I am willing to imagine that what I then
experienced was rather connected with the world of spirits and
dreams than with what I actually saw and heard around me.&nbsp;
Surely the elves and genii <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>of the place
were conversing, by some inscrutable means, with the principle of
intelligence lurking within the poor uncultivated clod!&nbsp;
Perhaps to that ethereal principle the wonders of the past, as
connected with that stream, the glories of the present, and even
the history of the future, were at that moment being
revealed!&nbsp; Of how many feats of chivalry had those old walls
been witness, when hostile kings contended for their
possession?&mdash;how many an army from the south and from the
north had trod that old bridge?&mdash;what red and noble blood
had crimsoned those rushing waters?&mdash;what strains had been
sung, ay, were yet being sung, on its banks?&mdash;some soft as
Doric reed; some fierce and sharp as those of Norwegian
Skaldaglam; some as replete with wild and wizard force as
Finland&rsquo;s runes, singing of Kalevala&rsquo;s moors, and the
deeds of Woinomoinen!&nbsp; Honour to thee, thou island
stream!&nbsp; Onward may thou ever roll, fresh and green,
rejoicing in thy bright past, thy glorious present, and in vivid
hope of a triumphant future!&nbsp; Flow on, beautiful
one!&mdash;which of the world&rsquo;s streams canst thou envy,
with thy beauty and renown?&nbsp; Stately is the Danube, rolling
in its might through lands romantic with the wild exploits of
Turk, Polak, and Magyar!&nbsp; Lovely is the Rhine! on its shelvy
banks grows the racy grape; and strange old keeps of
robber-knights of yore are reflected in its waters, from
picturesque crags and airy headlands!&mdash;yet neither the
stately Danube, nor the beauteous Rhine, with all their fame,
though abundant, needst thou envy, thou pure island
stream!&mdash;and far less yon turbid river of old, not modern
renown, gurgling beneath the walls of what was once proud Rome,
towering Rome, <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Jupiter&rsquo;s town, but now vile
Rome, crumbling Rome, Batuscha&rsquo;s town, far less needst thou
envy the turbid Tiber of bygone fame, creeping sadly to the sea,
surcharged with the abominations of modern Rome&mdash;how unlike
to thee, thou pure island stream!</p>
<p>And, as I lay on the bank and wept, there drew nigh to me a
man in the habiliments of a fisher.&nbsp; He was bare-legged, of
a weather-beaten countenance, and of stature approaching to the
gigantic.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the callant greeting for?&rdquo;
said he, as he stopped and surveyed me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has onybody
wrought ye ony harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; I replied, rather guessing
at than understanding his question; &ldquo;I was crying because I
could not help it!&nbsp; I say, old one, what is the name of this
river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hout!&nbsp; I now see what you was greeting at&mdash;at
your ain ignorance, nae doubt&mdash;&rsquo;tis very great!&nbsp;
Weel, I will na fash you with reproaches, but even enlighten ye,
since you seem a decent man&rsquo;s bairn, and you speir a civil
question.&nbsp; Yon river is called the Tweed; and yonder, over
the brig, is Scotland.&nbsp; Did ye never hear of the Tweed, my
bonny man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, as I rose from the grass, and
proceeded to cross the bridge to the town at which we had arrived
the preceding night; &ldquo;I never heard of it; but now I have
seen it, I shall not soon forget it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not long before we found ourselves at Edinburgh, <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a> or rather in the Castle, into which
the regiment marched with drums beating, colour-flying, and a
long train of baggage-waggons behind.&nbsp; The Castle was, as I
suppose it is now, a garrison for soldiers.&nbsp; Two other
regiments were already there; the one an Irish, if I remember
right, the other a small Highland corps.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to say much about this Castle, which
everybody has seen; on which account, doubtless, nobody has ever
yet thought fit to describe it&mdash;at least that I am
aware.&nbsp; Be this as it may, I have no intention of describing
it, and shall content myself with observing, that we took up our
abode in that immense building, or caserne, of modern erection,
which occupies the entire eastern <a name="citation69b"></a><a
href="#footnote69b" class="citation">[69b]</a> side of the bold
rock on which the Castle stands.&nbsp; A gallant caserne it
was&mdash;the best and roomiest that I had hitherto
seen&mdash;rather cold <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and windy, it is true, especially in
the winter, but commanding a noble prospect of a range of distant
hills, which I was told were &ldquo;the hieland hills,&rdquo; and
of a broad arm of the sea, which I heard somebody say was the
Firth of Forth.</p>
<p>My brother, who, for some years past, had been receiving his
education in a certain celebrated school in England, was now with
us; and it came to pass, that one day my father, as he sat at
table, looked steadfastly on my brother and myself, and then
addressed my mother:&mdash;&ldquo;During my journey down hither,
I have lost no opportunity of making inquiries about these
people, the Scotch, amongst whom we now are, and since I have
been here I have observed them attentively.&nbsp; From what I
have heard and seen, I should say that upon the whole they are a
very decent set of people; they seem acute and intelligent, and I
am told that their system of education is so excellent, that
every person is learned&mdash;more or less acquainted with Greek
and Latin.&nbsp; There is one thing, however, connected with
them, which is a great drawback&mdash;the horrid jargon which
they speak.&nbsp; However learned they may be in Greek and Latin,
their English is execrable; and yet I&rsquo;m told it is not so
bad as it was.&nbsp; I was in company, the other day, with an
Englishman who has resided here many years.&nbsp; We were talking
about the country and the people.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should like both
very well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;were it not for the
language.&nbsp; I wish sincerely our Parliament, which is passing
so many foolish Acts every year, would pass one to force these
Scotch to speak English.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish so,
too,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;The language is a disgrace to
the British Government; but, if you had heard it twenty years
<!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>ago, captain!&mdash;if you had heard it as it was spoken
when I first came to Edinburgh!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only custom,&rdquo; said my mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
daresay the language is now what it was then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said my father;
&ldquo;though I daresay you are right; it could never have been
worse than it is at present.&nbsp; But now to the point.&nbsp;
Were it not for the language, which, if the boys were to pick it
up, might ruin their prospects in life,&mdash;were it not for
that, I should very much like to send them to a school there is
in this place, which everybody talks about&mdash;the High School
I think they call it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis said to be the best school
in the whole island; but the idea of one&rsquo;s children
speaking Scotch&mdash;broad Scotch!&nbsp; I must think the matter
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did think the matter over; and the result of his
deliberation was a determination to send us to the school. <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; Let me call thee up before my
mind&rsquo;s eye, High School, to which, every morning, the two
English brothers took their way from the proud old Castle through
the lofty streets of the Old Town.&nbsp; High
School!&mdash;called so, I scarcely know why; neither lofty in
thyself nor by position, being situated in a flat bottom; oblong
structure of tawny stone, with many windows fenced with iron
netting&mdash;with thy long hall below, and thy five chambers
above, for the reception of the five classes, into which the
eight hundred urchins, who styled thee instructress, were
divided.&nbsp; <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Thy learned rector and his four
subordinate dominies; thy strange old porter of the tall form and
grizzled hair, hight Boee, <a name="citation72"></a><a
href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a> and doubtless of
Norse ancestry, as his name declares; perhaps of the blood of Bui
hin Digri, the hero of northern song&mdash;the Jomsborg Viking
who clove Thorsteinn Midlangr asunder in the dread sea battle of
Horunga Vog, and who, when the fight was lost and his own two
hands smitten off, seized two chests of gold with his bloody
stumps, and, springing with them into the sea, cried to the
scanty relics of his crew, &ldquo;Overboard now, all Bui&rsquo;s
lads!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, I remember all about thee, and how at
eight of every morn we were all gathered together with one accord
in the long hall, from which, after the litanies had been read
(for so I will call them, being an Episcopalian), the five
classes from the five sets of benches trotted off in long files,
one boy after the other, up the five spiral staircases of stone,
each class to its destination; and well do I remember how we of
the third sat hushed and still, watched by the eye of the dux,
until the door opened, and in walked that model of a good
Scotchman, the shrewd, intelligent, but warm-hearted and kind
dominie, the respectable Carson.</p>
<p>And in this school I began to construe the Latin language,
which I had never done before, notwithstanding my long and
diligent study of Lilly, which illustrious grammar was not used
at Edinburgh, nor indeed known.&nbsp; Greek was only taught in
the fifth or highest class, in which my brother was; as for
myself, I never got beyond the third during the two years that I
remained at this <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>seminary.&nbsp; I certainly acquired
here a considerable insight in the Latin tongue; and, to the
scandal of my father and horror of my mother, a thorough
proficiency in the Scotch, which, in less than two months,
usurped the place of the English, and so obstinately maintained
its ground, that I still can occasionally detect its lingering
remains.&nbsp; I did not spend my time unpleasantly at this
school, though, first of all, I had to pass through an
ordeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotland is a better country than England,&rdquo; said
an ugly, blear-eyed lad, about a head and shoulders taller than
myself, the leader of a gang of varlets who surrounded me in the
playground, on the first day, as soon as the morning lesson was
over.&nbsp; &ldquo;Scotland is a far better country than England,
in every respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you ought to be
very thankful for not having been born in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am, ye loon; and every
morning, when I say my prayers, I thank God for not being an
Englishman.&nbsp; The Scotch are a much better and braver people
than the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for what I
know&mdash;indeed, till I came here, I never heard a word either
about the Scotch or their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye making fun of us, ye English puppy?&rdquo; said
the blear-eyed lad; &ldquo;take that!&rdquo; and I was presently
beaten black and blue.&nbsp; And thus did I first become aware of
the difference of races and their antipathy to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bow to the storm, and it shall pass over
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I held my peace, and silently submitted to the
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>superiority of the Scotch&mdash;<i>in numbers</i>.&nbsp;
This was enough; from an object of persecution I soon became one
of patronage, especially amongst the champions of the
class.&nbsp; &ldquo;The English,&rdquo; said the blear-eyed lad,
&ldquo;though a wee bit behind the Scotch in strength and
fortitude, are nae to be sneezed at, being far ahead of the
Irish, to say nothing of the French, a pack of cowardly
scoundrels.&nbsp; And with regard to the English country, it is
na Scotland, it is true, but it has its gude properties; and,
though there is ne&rsquo;er a haggis in a&rsquo; the land,
there&rsquo;s an unco deal o&rsquo; gowd and siller.&nbsp; I
respect England, for I have an auntie married there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotch are certainly a most pugnacious people; their whole
history proves it.&nbsp; Witness their incessant wars with the
English in the olden time, and their internal feuds, highland and
lowland, clan with clan, family with family, Saxon with
Gael.&nbsp; In my time, the school-boys, for want, perhaps, of
English urchins to contend with, were continually fighting with
each other; every noon there was at least one pugilistic
encounter, and sometimes three.&nbsp; In one month I witnessed
more of these encounters than I had ever previously seen under
similar circumstances in England.&nbsp; After all, there was not
much harm done.&nbsp; Harm! what harm could result from short
chopping blows, a hug, and a tumble?&nbsp; I was witness to many
a sounding whack, some bloodshed, &ldquo;a blue ee&rdquo; now and
then, but nothing more.&nbsp; In England, on the contrary, where
the lads were comparatively mild, gentle, and pacific, I had been
present at more than one death caused by blows in boyish combats,
in which the oldest of the victors <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>had scarcely
reached thirteen years; but these blows were in the jugular,
given with the full force of the arm shot out horizontally from
the shoulder.</p>
<p>But the Scotch&mdash;though by no means proficients in boxing
(and how should they box, seeing that they have never had a
teacher?)&mdash;are, I repeat, a most pugnacious people; at least
they were in my time.&nbsp; Anything served them, that is, the
urchins, as a pretence for a fray, or, Dorically speaking, a
<i>bicker</i>; every street and close was at feud with its
neighbour; the lads of the school were at feud with the young men
of the college, whom they pelted in winter with snow, and in
summer with stones; and then the feud between the Old and New
Town!</p>
<p>One day I was standing on the ramparts of the Castle on the
south-western <a name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> side which overhangs the green brae,
where it slopes down into what was in those days the green swamp
or morass, called by the natives of Auld Reekie the Nor Loch; it
was a dark gloomy day, and a thin veil of mist was beginning to
settle down upon the brae and the morass.&nbsp; I could perceive,
however, that there was a skirmish taking place in the latter
spot.&nbsp; I had an indistinct view of two
parties&mdash;apparently of urchins&mdash;and I heard whoops and
shrill cries: eager to know the cause of this disturbance, I left
the Castle, and descending the brae reached the borders of the
morass, where was a runnel of water and the remains of an old
wall, on the other side of which a narrow path led across the
swamp: upon this path at a little distance before me there was
&ldquo;a bicker.&rdquo;&nbsp; I pushed <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>forward, but
had scarcely crossed the ruined wall and runnel, when the party
nearest to me gave way, and in great confusion came running in my
direction.&nbsp; As they drew nigh, one of them shouted to me,
&ldquo;Wha are ye, man? are ye o&rsquo; the Auld
Toon?&rdquo;&nbsp; I made no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! ye are
o&rsquo; the New Toon; De&rsquo;il tak ye, we&rsquo;ll moorder
ye;&rdquo; and the next moment a huge stone sung past my
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me be, ye fule bodies,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no of either of ye, I live yonder aboon in the
Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! ye live in the Castle; then
ye&rsquo;re an Auld Tooner.&nbsp; Come gie us your help, man, and
dinna stand there staring like a dunnot; we want help sair
eneugh.&nbsp; Here are stanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For my own part I wished for nothing better, and, rushing
forward, I placed myself at the head of my new associates, and
commenced flinging stones fast and desperately.&nbsp; The other
party now gave way in their turn, closely followed by ourselves;
I was in the van, and about to stretch out my hand to seize the
hindermost boy of the enemy, when, not being acquainted with the
miry and difficult paths of the Nor Loch, and in my eagerness
taking no heed of my footing, I plunged into a quagmire, into
which I sank as far as my shoulders.&nbsp; Our adversaries no
sooner perceived this disaster, than, setting up a shout, they
wheeled round and attacked us most vehemently.&nbsp; Had my
comrades now deserted me, my life had not been worth a
straw&rsquo;s purchase, I should either have been smothered in
the quag, or, what is more probable, had my brains beaten out
with stones; but they behaved like true Scots, and fought stoutly
around their comrade, until I was extricated, <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>whereupon
both parties retired, the night being near at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye are na a bad hand at flinging stanes,&rdquo; said
the lad who first addressed me, as we now returned up the brae;
&ldquo;your aim is right dangerous, man; I saw how ye skelpit
them; ye maun help us agin thae New Toon blackguards at our next
bicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So to the next bicker I went, and to many more, which speedily
followed as the summer advanced; the party to which I had given
my help on the first occasion consisted merely of outlyers,
posted about half way up the hill, for the purpose of overlooking
the movements of the enemy.</p>
<p>Did the latter draw nigh in any considerable force, messengers
were forthwith despatched to the &ldquo;Auld Toon,&rdquo;
especially to the filthy alleys and closes of the High Street,
which forthwith would disgorge swarms of bare-headed and
bare-footed &ldquo;callants,&rdquo; who, with gestures wild and
&ldquo;eldrich screech and hollo,&rdquo; might frequently be seen
pouring down the sides of the hill.&nbsp; I have seen upwards of
a thousand engaged on either side in these frays, which I have no
doubt were full as desperate as the fights described in the
Iliad, and which were certainly much more bloody than the combats
of modern Greece in the war of independence: the callants not
only employed their hands in hurling stones, but not unfrequently
slings; at the use of which they were very expert, and which
occasionally dislodged teeth, shattered jaws, or knocked out an
eye.&nbsp; Our opponents certainly laboured under considerable
disadvantage, being compelled not only to wade across a deceitful
bog, but likewise to clamber up part of a steep hill before they
could attack us; nevertheless, their determination was <!-- page
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>such,
and such their impetuosity, that we had sometimes difficulty
enough to maintain our own.&nbsp; I shall never forget one
bicker, the last indeed which occurred at that time, as the
authorities of the town, alarmed by the desperation of its
character, stationed forthwith a body of police on the hillside,
to prevent, in future, any such breaches of the peace.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful Sunday evening, the rays of the descending
sun were reflected redly from the grey walls of the Castle, and
from the black rocks on which it was founded.&nbsp; The bicker
had long since commenced, stones from sling and hand were flying;
but the callants of the New Town were now carrying everything
before them.</p>
<p>A full-grown baker&rsquo;s apprentice was at their head; he
was foaming with rage, and had taken the field, as I was told, in
order to avenge his brother, whose eye had been knocked out in
one of the late bickers.&nbsp; He was no slinger or flinger, but
brandished in his right hand the spoke of a cart-wheel, like my
countryman Tom Hickathrift of old in his encounter with the giant
of the Lincolnshire fen.&nbsp; Protected by a piece of
wicker-work attached to his left arm, he rushed on to the fray,
disregarding the stones which were showered against him, and was
ably seconded by his followers.&nbsp; Our own party was chased
half way up the hill, where I was struck to the ground by the
baker, after having been foiled in an attempt which I had made to
fling a handful of earth into his eyes.&nbsp; All now appeared
lost, the Auld Toon was in full retreat.&nbsp; I myself lay at
the baker&rsquo;s feet, who had just raised his spoke, probably
to give me the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>,&mdash;it was an awful
moment.&nbsp; Just then I <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>heard a shout
and a rushing sound; a wild-looking figure is descending the hill
with terrible bounds; it is a lad of some fifteen years; he is
bare-headed, and his red uncombed hair stands on end like
hedgehogs&rsquo; bristles; his frame is lithy, like that of an
antelope, but he has prodigious breadth of chest; he wears a
military undress, that of the regiment, even of a drummer, for it
is wild Davy, <a name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a> whom a month before I had seen enlisted
on Leith Links to serve King George with drum and drumstick as
long as his services might be required, and who, ere a week had
elapsed, had smitten with his fist Drum-Major Elzigood, who,
incensed at his inaptitude, had threatened him with his cane; he
has been in confinement for weeks, this is the first day of his
liberation, and he is now descending the hill with horrid bounds
and shoutings; he is now about five yards distant, and the baker,
who apprehends that something dangerous is at hand, prepares
himself for the encounter; but what avails the strength of a
baker, even full grown?&mdash;what avails the defence of a wicker
shield?&mdash;what avails the wheel-spoke, should there be an
opportunity of using it, against the impetus of an avalanche or a
cannon ball?&mdash;for to either of these might that wild figure
be compared, which, at the distance of five yards, sprang at once
with head, hands, feet and body, all together, upon the champion
of the New Town, tumbling him to the earth amain.&nbsp; And now
it was the turn of the <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Old Town to triumph.&nbsp; Our late
discomfited host, returning on its steps, overwhelmed the fallen
champion with blows of every kind, and then, led on by his
vanquisher, who had assumed his arms, namely, the wheel-spoke and
wicker shield, fairly cleared the brae of their adversaries, whom
they drove down headlong into the morass.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I had become a daring cragsman, a character to which
an English lad has seldom opportunities of aspiring; for in
England there are neither crags nor mountains.&nbsp; Of these,
however, as is well known, there is no lack in Scotland, and the
habits of individuals are invariably in harmony with the country
in which they dwell.&nbsp; The Scotch are expert climbers, and I
was now a Scot in most things, particularly in language.&nbsp;
The Castle in which I dwelt stood upon a rock, a bold and craggy
one, which, at first sight, would seem to bid defiance to any
feet save those of goats and chamois; but patience and
perseverance generally enable mankind to overcome things which,
at first sight, appear impossible.&nbsp; Indeed, what is there
above man&rsquo;s exertions?&nbsp; Unwearied determination will
enable him to run with the horse, to swim with the fish, and
assuredly to compete with the chamois and the goat in agility and
sureness of foot.&nbsp; To scale the rock was merely
child&rsquo;s play for the Edinbro&rsquo; callants.&nbsp; It <!--
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>was my own favourite diversion.&nbsp; I soon found that
the rock contained all manner of strange crypts, crannies, and
recesses, where owls nestled, and the weasel brought forth her
young; here and there were small natural platforms, overgrown
with long grass and various kinds of plants, where the climber,
if so disposed, could stretch himself, and either give his eyes
to sleep or his mind to thought; for capital places were these
same platforms either for repose or meditation.&nbsp; The boldest
features of the rock are descried on the southern <a
name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a> side, where, after shelving down
gently from the wall for some distance, it terminates abruptly in
a precipice, black and horrible, of some three hundred feet <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> at least, as if the axe of nature had
been here employed cutting sheer down, and leaving behind neither
excrescence nor spur&mdash;a dizzy precipice it is, assimilating
much to those so frequent in the flinty hills of Northern Africa,
and exhibiting some distant resemblance to that of Gibraltar,
towering in its horridness above the neutral ground.</p>
<p>It was now holiday time, and having nothing particular
wherewith to occupy myself, I not unfrequently passed the greater
part of the day upon the rocks.&nbsp; Once, after scaling the
western crags, and creeping round a sharp angle of the wall,
overhung by a kind of watch tower, I found myself on the southern
side.&nbsp; Still keeping close to the wall, I was proceeding
onward, for I was bent upon a long excursion which should embrace
half the circuit of the Castle, when suddenly my eye was
attracted by the appearance of something red, far below me; I
stopped short, and, looking fixedly upon it, perceived that it
was a human <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>being in a kind of red jacket, seated
on the extreme verge of the precipice, which I have already made
a faint attempt to describe.&nbsp; Wondering who it could be, I
shouted; but it took not the slightest notice, remaining as
immovable as the rock on which it sat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should
never have thought of going near that edge,&rdquo; said I to
myself; &ldquo;however, as you have done it, why should not
I?&nbsp; And I should like to know who you are.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I
commenced the descent of the rock, but with great care, for I had
as yet never been in a situation so dangerous; a slight moisture
exuded from the palms of my hands, my nerves were tingling, and
my brain was somewhat dizzy&mdash;and now I had arrived within a
few yards of the figure, and had recognised it: it was the wild
drummer who had turned the tide of battle in the bicker on the
Castle Brae.&nbsp; A small stone which I dislodged now rolled
down the rock, and tumbled into the abyss close beside him.&nbsp;
He turned his head, and after looking at me for a moment somewhat
vacantly, he resumed his former attitude.&nbsp; I drew yet nearer
to the horrible edge; not close, however, for fear was on me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, David?&rdquo; said I, as I
sat behind him and trembled, for I repeat that I was afraid.</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; I was thinking of Willie
Wallace.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You had better be thinking of yourself,
man.&nbsp; A strange place this to come to and think of William
Wallace.</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; Why so?&nbsp; Is not his tower
just beneath our feet?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You mean the auld ruin by the side of
<!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>the Nor Loch&mdash;the ugly stane bulk, from the foot of
which flows the spring into the dyke, where the watercresses
grow?</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; Just sae, Geordie.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And why were ye thinking of him?&nbsp;
The English hanged him long since, as I have heard say.</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; I was thinking that I should wish
to be like him.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Do ye mean that ye would wish to be
hanged?</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; I wad na flinch from that,
Geordie, if I might be a great man first.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And wha kens, Davie, how great you may
be, even without hanging?&nbsp; Are ye not in the high road of
preferment?&nbsp; Are ye not a bauld drummer already?&nbsp; Wha
kens how high ye may rise? perhaps to be general, or
drum-major.</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; I hae na wish to be drum-major; it
were na great things to be like the doited carle, Else-than-gude,
as they call him; and, troth, he has na his name for
naething.&nbsp; But I should have nae objection to be a general,
and to fight the French and Americans, and win myself a name and
a fame like Willie Wallace, and do brave deeds, such as I have
been reading about in his story book.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Ye are a fule, Davie; the story book is
full of lies.&nbsp; Wallace, indeed! the wuddie rebel!&nbsp; I
have heard my father say that the Duke of Cumberland was worth
twenty of Willie Wallace.</p>
<p><i>David Haggart</i>.&nbsp; Ye had better say naething agin
Willie Wallace, Geordie, for, if ye do, De&rsquo;il hae me, if I
dinna tumble ye doon the craig.</p>

85</span>Fine materials in that lad for a hero, you will
say.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, for a hero, or for what he afterwards
became.&nbsp; In other times, and under other circumstances, he
might have made what is generally termed a great man, a patriot,
or a conqueror.&nbsp; As it was, the very qualities which might
then have pushed him on to fortune and renown were the cause of
his ruin.&nbsp; The war over, he fell into evil courses; for his
wild heart and ambitious spirit could not brook the sober and
quiet pursuits of honest industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can an Arabian steed submit to be a vile drudge?&rdquo;
cries the fatalist.&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; A man is not an
irrational creature, but a reasoning being, and has something
within him beyond mere brutal instinct.&nbsp; The greatest
victory which a man can achieve is over himself, by which is
meant those unruly passions which are not convenient to the time
and place.&nbsp; David did not do this; he gave the reins to his
wild heart, instead of curbing it, and became a robber, and,
alas! alas! he shed blood&mdash;under peculiar circumstances, it
is true, and without <i>malice pr&eacute;pense</i>&mdash;and for
that blood he eventually died, and justly; for it was that of the
warden of a prison from which he was escaping, and whom he slew
with one blow of his stalwart arm.</p>
<p>Tamerlane and Haggart!&nbsp; Haggart and Tamerlane!&nbsp; Both
these men were robbers, and of low birth, yet one perished on an
ignoble scaffold, and the other died emperor of the world.&nbsp;
Is this justice?&nbsp; The ends of the two men were widely
dissimilar&mdash;yet what is the intrinsic difference between
them?&nbsp; Very great, indeed; the one acted according to his
lights and his country, not <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>so the
other.&nbsp; Tamerlane was a heathen, and acted according to his
lights; he was a robber where all around were robbers, but he
became the avenger of God&mdash;God&rsquo;s scourge on unjust
kings, on the cruel Bajazet, who had plucked out his own
brothers&rsquo; eyes; he became to a certain extent the purifier
of the East, its regenerator; his equal never was before, nor has
it since been seen.&nbsp; Here the wild heart was profitably
employed, the wild strength, the teeming brain.&nbsp; Onward,
Lame one!&nbsp; Onward, Tamur&mdash;lank!&nbsp; Haggart. . .
.</p>
<p>But peace to thee, poor David! why should a mortal worm be
sitting in judgment over thee?&nbsp; The Mighty and Just One has
already judged thee, and perhaps above thou hast received pardon
for thy crimes, which could not be pardoned here below; and now
that thy feverish existence has closed, and thy once active form
become inanimate dust, thy very memory all but forgotten, I will
say a few words about thee, a few words soon also to be
forgotten.&nbsp; Thou wast the most extraordinary robber that
ever lived within the belt of Britain; Scotland rang with thy
exploits, and England, too, north of the Humber; strange deeds
also didst thou achieve when, fleeing from justice, thou didst
find thyself in the Sister Isle; busy wast thou there in town and
on curragh, at fair and race-course, and also in the solitary
place.&nbsp; Ireland thought thee her child, for who spoke her
brogue better than thyself?&mdash;she felt proud of thee, and
said, &ldquo;Sure, O&rsquo;Hanlon is come again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What might not have been thy fate in the far west in America,
whither thou hadst turned thine eye, saying, &ldquo;I will go
there, and become an honest man!&rdquo;&nbsp; But thou wast not
to go there, David&mdash;<!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the blood
which thou hadst shed in Scotland was to be required of thee; the
avenger was at hand, the avenger of blood.&nbsp; Seized,
manacled, brought back to thy native land, condemned to die, thou
wast left in thy narrow cell, and told to make the most of thy
time, for it was short: and there, in thy narrow cell, and thy
time so short, thou didst put the crowning stone to thy strange
deeds, by that strange history of thyself, penned by thy own hand
in the robber tongue.&nbsp; Thou mightest have been better
employed, David!&mdash;but the ruling passion was strong with
thee, even in the jaws of death.&nbsp; Thou mightest have been
better employed!&mdash;but peace be with thee, I repeat, and the
Almighty&rsquo;s grace and pardon.</p>

<p>Napoleon&mdash;The Storm&mdash;The Cove&mdash;Up the
Country&mdash;The Trembling Hand&mdash;Irish&mdash;Tough
Battle&mdash;Tipperary Hills&mdash;Elegant Lodgings&mdash;A
Speech&mdash;Fair Specimen&mdash;Orangemen.</p>
<p>Onward, onward! and after we had sojourned in Scotland nearly
two years, <a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a> the long Continental war had been
brought to an end, Napoleon was humbled for a time, and the
Bourbons restored to a land which could well have dispensed with
them; we returned to England, where the corps was disbanded, and
my parents with their family retired to private life.&nbsp; I
shall pass over in silence the events of a year, which offer
little of interest as far as connected with me and mine.&nbsp;
Suddenly, however, the sound of war was heard again, Napoleon had
broken forth from Elba, and everything was in confusion.&nbsp;
Vast military preparations were again made, our own corps was
levied anew, and my brother became an officer in it; but the
danger was soon over, Napoleon was once more quelled, and chained
for ever, like Prometheus, to his rock.&nbsp; As the corps,
however, though so recently levied, had already become a very
fine one, thanks to my father&rsquo;s energetic drilling, the
<!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Government very properly determined to turn it to some
account, and, as disturbances were apprehended in Ireland about
this period, it occurred to them that they could do no better
than despatch it to that country.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year 1815, we set sail from a port in
Essex; <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> we were some eight hundred strong, and
were embarked in two ships, very large, but old and crazy; a
storm overtook us when off Beachy Head, in which we had nearly
foundered.&nbsp; I was awakened early in the morning by the
howling of the wind, and the uproar on deck.&nbsp; I kept myself
close, however, as is still my constant practice on similar
occasions, and waited the result with that apathy and
indifference which violent sea-sickness is sure to produce.&nbsp;
We shipped several seas, and once the vessel missing
stays&mdash;which, to do it justice, it generally did at every
third or fourth tack&mdash;we escaped almost by a miracle from
being dashed upon the foreland.&nbsp; On the eighth day of our
voyage we were in sight of Ireland.&nbsp; The weather was now
calm and serene, the sun shone brightly on the sea and on certain
green hills in the distance, on which I descried what at first
sight I believed to be two ladies gathering flowers, which,
however, on our nearer approach, proved to be two tall white
towers, doubtless built for some purpose or other, though I did
not learn for what.</p>
<p>We entered a kind of bay, or cove, <a
name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a> by a narrow inlet; it was a beautiful
and romantic place this cove, very spacious, and, being nearly
land-locked, was sheltered from every wind.&nbsp; A small island,
every inch of which was covered with fortifications, <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>appeared to swim upon the waters, whose dark blue
denoted their immense depth; tall green hills, which ascended
gradually from the shore, formed the background to the west; they
were carpeted to the top with turf of the most vivid green, and
studded here and there with woods, seemingly of oak; there was a
strange old castle half way up the ascent, a village on a
crag&mdash;but the mists of morning were half veiling the scene
when I surveyed it, and the mists of time are now hanging densely
between it and my no longer youthful eye; I may not describe
it;&mdash;nor will I try.</p>
<p>Leaving the ship in the cove, we passed up a wide river in
boats till we came to a city, <a name="citation90"></a><a
href="#footnote90" class="citation">[90]</a> where we
disembarked.&nbsp; It was a large city, as large as Edinburgh to
my eyes; there were plenty of fine houses, but little neatness;
the streets were full of impurities; handsome equipages rolled
along, but the greater part of the population were in rags;
beggars abounded; there was no lack of merriment, however;
boisterous shouts of laughter were heard on every side.&nbsp; It
appeared a city of contradictions.&nbsp; After a few days&rsquo;
rest we marched from this place in two divisions.&nbsp; My father
commanded the second, I walked by his side.</p>
<p>Our route lay up the country; the country at first offered no
very remarkable feature, it was pretty, but tame.&nbsp; On the
second day, however, its appearance had altered, it had become
more wild; a range of distant mountains bounded the
horizon.&nbsp; We passed through several villages, as I suppose I
may term them, of low huts, the walls formed of rough stones
without mortar, the roof of flags laid over wattles and
wicker-work; they <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>seemed to be inhabited solely by
women and children; the latter were naked, the former, in
general, blear-eyed beldames, who sat beside the doors on low
stools, spinning.&nbsp; We saw, however, both men and women
working at a distance in the fields.</p>
<p>I was thirsty; and going up to an ancient crone, employed in
the manner which I have described, I asked her for water; she
looked me in the face, appeared to consider a moment, then
tottering into her hut, presently reappeared with a small pipkin
of milk, which she offered to me with a trembling hand.&nbsp; I
drank the milk; it was sour, but I found it highly
refreshing.&nbsp; I then took out a penny and offered it to her,
whereupon she shook her head, smiled, and, patting my face with
her skinny hand, murmured some words in a tongue which I had
never heard before.</p>
<p>I walked on by my father&rsquo;s side, holding the
stirrup-leather of his horse; presently several low uncouth cars
passed by, drawn by starved cattle: the drivers were tall
fellows, with dark features and athletic frames&mdash;they wore
long loose blue cloaks with sleeves, which last, however, dangled
unoccupied: these cloaks appeared in tolerably good condition,
not so their under garments.&nbsp; On their heads were broad
slouching hats: the generality of them were bare-footed.&nbsp; As
they passed, the soldiers jested with them in the patois of East
Anglia, whereupon the fellows laughed, and appeared to jest with
the soldiers; but what they said who knows, it being in a rough
guttural language, strange and wild.&nbsp; The soldiers stared at
each other, and were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange language that!&rdquo; said a young <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>officer to my father, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand a
word of it; what can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish!&rdquo; said my father, with a loud voice,
&ldquo;and a bad language it is.&nbsp; I have known it of old,
that is, I have often heard it spoken when I was a guardsman in
London.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one part of London where all the
Irish live&mdash;at least all the worst of them&mdash;and there
they hatch their villanies and speak this tongue; it is that
which keeps them together and makes them dangerous: I was once
sent there to seize a couple of deserters&mdash;Irish&mdash;who
had taken refuge amongst their companions; we found them in what
was in my time called a ken, that is a house where only thieves
and desperadoes are to be found.&nbsp; Knowing on what kind of
business I was bound, I had taken with me a sergeant&rsquo;s
party; it was well I did so.&nbsp; We found the deserters in a
large room, with at least thirty ruffians, horrid-looking
fellows, seated about a long table, drinking, swearing, and
talking Irish.&nbsp; Ah! we had a tough battle, I remember; the
two fellows did nothing, but sat still, thinking it best to be
quiet; but the rest, with an ubbubboo, like the blowing up of a
powder-magazine, sprang up, brandishing their sticks; for these
fellows always carry sticks with them even to bed, and not
unfrequently spring up in their sleep, striking left and
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you take the deserters?&rdquo; said the
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;for we formed at the
end of the room, and charged with fixed bayonets, which compelled
the others to yield notwithstanding their numbers; but the worst
was when we got out into the street; the whole district had
become alarmed, and hundreds came pouring down upon us&mdash;<!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>men, women, and children.&nbsp; Women, did I
say!&mdash;they looked fiends, half naked, with their hair
hanging down over their bosoms; they tore up the very pavement to
hurl at us, sticks rang about our ears, stones, and Irish&mdash;I
liked the Irish worst of all, it sounded so horrid, especially as
I did not understand it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bad
language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A queer tongue,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I wonder if I
could learn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn it!&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;what should you
learn it for?&mdash;however, I am not afraid of that.&nbsp; It is
not like Scotch; no person can learn it, save those who are born
to it, and even in Ireland the respectable people do not speak
it, only the wilder sort, like those we have passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a day or two we had reached a tall range of mountains
running north and south, which I was told were those of
Tipperary; along the skirts of these we proceeded till we came to
a town, <a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a> the principal one of these
regions.&nbsp; It was on the bank of a beautiful river, which
separated it from the mountains.&nbsp; It was rather an ancient
place, and might contain some ten thousand inhabitants&mdash;I
found that it was our destination; there were extensive barracks
at the farther end, in which the corps took up its quarters; with
respect to ourselves, we took lodgings in a house which stood in
the principal street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw more elegant lodgings than these,
captain,&rdquo; said the master of the house, a tall, handsome,
and athletic man, who came up whilst our little family were
seated at dinner late in the afternoon of the day of our arrival;
&ldquo;they beat anything in this town of Clonmel.&nbsp; I do not
let <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>them for the sake of interest, and to none but gentlemen
in the army, in order that myself and my wife, who is from
Londonderry, may have the advantage of pleasant company, genteel
company; ay, and Protestant company, captain.&nbsp; It did my
heart good when I saw your honour ride in at the head of all
those fine fellows, real Protestants, I&rsquo;ll engage, not a
Papist among them, they are too good-looking and honest-looking
for that.&nbsp; So I no sooner saw your honour at the head of
your army, with that handsome young gentleman holding by your
stirrup, than I said to my wife, Mistress Hyne, who is from
Londonderry, &lsquo;God bless me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what a
truly Protestant countenance, what a noble bearing, and what a
sweet young gentleman.&nbsp; By the silver hairs of his
honour&mdash;and sure enough I never saw hairs more regally
silver than those of your honour&mdash;by his honour&rsquo;s grey
silver hairs, and by my own soul, which is not worthy to be
mentioned in the same day with one of them&mdash;it would be no
more than decent and civil to run out and welcome such a father
and son coming in at the head of such a Protestant
military.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then my wife, who is from Londonderry,
Mistress Hyne, looking me in the face like a fairy as she is,
&lsquo;You may say that,&rsquo; says she.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would
be but decent and civil, honey.&rsquo;&nbsp; And your honour
knows how I ran out of my own door and welcomed your honour
riding in company with your son, who was walking; how I welcomed
ye both at the head of your royal regiment, and how I shook your
honour by the hand, saying, I am glad to see your honour, and
your honour&rsquo;s son, and your honour&rsquo;s royal military
Protestant regiment.&nbsp; And now I have you in the house, and
right proud I am to have ye one and all; <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>one, two,
three, four, true Protestants every one, no Papists here; and I
have made bold to bring up a bottle of claret which is now
waiting behind the door; and, when your honour and your family
have dined, I will make bold too to bring up Mistress Hyne, from
Londonderry, to introduce to your honour&rsquo;s lady, and then
we&rsquo;ll drink to the health of King George, God bless him; to
the &lsquo;glorious and immortal&rsquo;&mdash;to Boyne
water&mdash;to your honour&rsquo;s speedy promotion to be Lord
Lieutenant, and to the speedy downfall of the Pope and Saint
Anthony of Padua.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the speech of the Irish Protestant addressed to my
father in the long lofty dining-room with three windows, looking
upon the High Street of the good town of Clonmel, as he sat at
meat with his family, after saying grace like a true-hearted
respectable soldier as he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bigot and an Orangeman!&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; It
is easier to apply epithets of opprobrium to people than to make
yourself acquainted with their history and position.&nbsp; He was
a specimen, and a fair specimen, of a most remarkable body of
men, who during two centuries have fought a good fight in Ireland
in the cause of civilisation and religious truth; they were sent
as colonists, few in number, into a barbarous and unhappy
country, where ever since, though surrounded with difficulties of
every kind, they have maintained their ground; theirs has been no
easy life, nor have their lines fallen upon very pleasant places;
amidst darkness they have held up a lamp, and it would be well
for Ireland were all her children like these her adopted
ones.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they are fierce and sanguinary,&rdquo; it
is said.&nbsp; Ay, ay! they have not unfrequently opposed the
keen sword <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>to the savage pike.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
they are bigoted and narrow-minded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, ay! they do
not like idolatry, and will not bow the knee before a
stone!&nbsp; &ldquo;But their language is frequently
indecorous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Go to, my dainty one, did ye ever listen
to the voice of Papist cursing?</p>
<p>The Irish Protestants have faults, numerous ones; but the
greater number of these may be traced to the peculiar
circumstances of their position: but they have virtues, numerous
ones; and their virtues are their own, their industry, their
energy, and their undaunted resolution are their own.&nbsp; They
have been vilified and traduced&mdash;but what would Ireland be
without them?&nbsp; I repeat, that it would be well for her were
all her sons no worse than these much calumniated children of her
adoption.</p>

Christmas.</p>
<p>We continued at this place for some months, during which time
the soldiers performed their duties, whatever they were; and I,
having no duties to perform, was sent to school.&nbsp; I had been
to English schools, and to the celebrated one of Edinburgh; but
my education, at the present day, would not be what it
is&mdash;perfect, had I never had the honour of being
<i>alumnus</i> in an Irish seminary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said our kind host, &ldquo;you would,
no doubt, wish that the young gentleman should enjoy every
advantage which the town may afford towards helping him on in the
path of genteel learning.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great pity that he
should waste his time in idleness&mdash;doing nothing else than
what he says he has been doing for the last
fortnight&mdash;fishing in the river for trouts which he never
catches; and wandering up the glen in the mountain, in search of
the hips that grow there.&nbsp; Now, we have a school here, where
he can learn the most elegant Latin, and get an insight into the
Greek letters, which is desirable; and where, moreover, he will
have an opportunity of <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>making acquaintance with all the
Protestant young gentlemen of the place, the handsome
well-dressed young persons whom your honour sees in the church on
the Sundays, when your honour goes there in the morning, with the
rest of the Protestant military; for it is no Papist school,
though there may be a Papist or two there&mdash;a few poor
farmers&rsquo; sons from the country, with whom there is no
necessity for your honour&rsquo;s child to form any acquaintance
at all, at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to the school I went, where I read the Latin tongue and
the Greek letters, with a nice old clergyman, who sat behind a
black oaken desk, with a huge Elzevir <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a> Flaccus before him,
in a long gloomy kind of hall, with a broken stone floor, the
roof festooned with cobwebs, the walls considerably dilapidated,
and covered over with strange figures and hieroglyphics,
evidently produced by the application of burnt stick; and there I
made acquaintance with the Protestant young gentlemen of the
place, who, with whatever <i>&eacute;clat</i> they might appear
at church on a Sunday, did assuredly not exhibit to much
advantage in the school-room on the week days, either with
respect to clothes or looks.&nbsp; And there I was in the habit
of sitting on a large stone, before the roaring fire in the huge
open chimney, and entertaining certain of the Protestant young
gentlemen of my own age, seated on similar stones, with
extraordinary accounts of my own adventures, and those of the
corps, with an occasional anecdote extracted from the story-books
of Hickathrift and Wight Wallace, pretending to be conning the
lesson all the while.</p>
<p>And there I made acquaintance, notwithstanding <!-- page
99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the
hint of the landlord, with the Papist &ldquo;gossoons,&rdquo; as
they were called, the farmers&rsquo; sons from the country; and
of these gossoons, of which there were three, two might be
reckoned as nothing at all; in the third, however, I soon
discovered that there was something extraordinary.</p>
<p>He was about sixteen years old, and above six feet high,
dressed in a grey suit; the coat, from its size, appeared to have
been made for him some ten years before.&nbsp; He was remarkably
narrow-chested and round-shouldered, owing perhaps as much to the
tightness of his garment as to the hand of nature.&nbsp; His face
was long, and his complexion swarthy, relieved, however, by
certain freckles, with which the skin was plentifully
studded.&nbsp; He had strange wandering eyes, grey, and somewhat
unequal in size; they seldom rested on the book, but were
generally wandering about the room, from one object to
another.&nbsp; Sometimes he would fix them intently on the wall,
and then suddenly starting, as if from a reverie, he would
commence making certain mysterious movements with his thumbs and
forefingers, as if he were shuffling something from him.</p>
<p>One morning, as he sat by himself on a bench, engaged in this
manner, I went up to him, and said, &ldquo;Good day, Murtagh; you
do not seem to have much to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, you may say that, Shorsha dear!&mdash;it is
seldom much to do that I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing with your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, then, if I must tell you, I was e&rsquo;en
dealing with the cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you play much at cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorra a game, Shorsha, have I played with the <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>cards since my uncle Phelim, the thief! stole away the
ould pack, when he went to settle in the county
Waterford!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have other things to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorra anything else has Murtagh to do that he cares
about; and that makes me dread so going home at
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know all about you; where do you live,
joy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, then, ye shall know all about me, and where I
live.&nbsp; It is at a place called the Wilderness that I live,
and they call it so, because it is a fearful wild place, without
any house near it but my father&rsquo;s own; and that&rsquo;s
where I live when at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father is a farmer, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say that; and it is a farmer I should have
been, like my brother Denis, had not my uncle Phelim, the thief!
tould my father to send me to school, to learn Greek letters,
that I might be made a saggart of, and sent to Paris and
Salamanca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would rather be a farmer than a
priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say that!&mdash;for, were I a farmer, like the
rest, I should have something to do, like the
rest&mdash;something that I cared for&mdash;and I should come
home tired at night, and fall asleep, as the rest do, before the
fire; but when I comes home at night I am not tired, for I have
been doing nothing all day that I care for; and then I sits down
and stares about me, and at the fire, till I become frighted; and
then I shouts to my brother Denis, or to the gossoons, &lsquo;Get
up, I say, and let&rsquo;s be doing something; tell us the tale
of Finn-ma-Coul, and how he lay down in the Shannon&rsquo;s bed,
and <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>let the river flow down his
jaws!&rsquo;&nbsp; Arrah, Shorsha!&nbsp; I wish you would come
and stay with us, and tell us some o&rsquo; your sweet stories of
your ownself and the snake ye carried about wid ye.&nbsp; Faith,
Shorsha dear! that snake bates anything about Finn-ma-Coul or
Brian Boroo, the thieves two, bad luck to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do they get up and tell you stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they does, but oftenmost they curses me, and
bids me be quiet!&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t be quiet, either before
the fire or abed; so I runs out of the house, and stares at the
rocks, at the trees, and sometimes at the clouds, as they run a
race across the bright moon; and, the more I stares, the more
frighted I grows, till I screeches and holloas.&nbsp; And last
night I went into the barn, and hid my face in the straw; and
there, as I lay and shivered in the straw, I heard a voice above
my head singing out &lsquo;To whit, to whoo!&rsquo; and then up I
starts, and runs into the house, and falls over my brother Denis,
as he lies at the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that
for?&rsquo; says he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get up, you thief!&rsquo; says
I, &lsquo;and be helping me.&nbsp; I have been out into the barn,
and an owl has crow&rsquo;d at me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what has this to do with playing cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little enough, Shorsha dear!&mdash;If there were
card-playing, I should not be frighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why do you not play at cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you that the thief, my uncle Phelim,
stole away the pack?&nbsp; If we had the pack, my brother Denis
and the gossoons would be ready enough to get up from their sleep
before the fire, and play cards with me for ha&rsquo;pence, or
eggs, or nothing at all; but the pack is gone&mdash;bad luck to
the thief who took it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;And why don&rsquo;t you buy another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it of buying you are speaking?&nbsp; And where am I
to get the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s another thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith it is, honey!&mdash;And now the Christmas
holidays is coming, when I shall be at home by day as well as
night, and then what am I to do?&nbsp; Since I have been a
saggarting, I have been good for nothing at all&mdash;neither for
work nor Greek&mdash;only to play cards!&nbsp; Faith, it&rsquo;s
going mad I will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Murtagh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Shorsha dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a pack of cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so, Shorsha ma vourneen?&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t say that you have cards fifty-two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, though; and they are quite new&mdash;never been
once used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be lending them to me, I
warrant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think it!&mdash;But I&rsquo;ll sell them to
you, joy, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanam mon Dioul! am I not after telling you that I have
no money at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have as good as money, to me, at least; and
I&rsquo;ll take it in exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Shorsha dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you speak Irish; I heard you talking it the other
day to the cripple.&nbsp; You shall teach me Irish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it a language-master you&rsquo;d be making of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&mdash;what better can you do?&mdash;it <!--

can&rsquo;t learn Greek, so you must teach Irish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Murtagh was playing at cards with his
brother Denis, and I could speak a considerable quantity of
broken Irish.</p>

World&mdash;Ruined Castle&mdash;Grim and Desolate&mdash;The
Donjon&mdash;Old Woman&mdash;My Own House.</p>
<p>When Christmas was over, and the new year commenced, we broke
up our quarters, and marched away to Templemore. <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a>&nbsp; This was a large military
station, situated in a wild and thinly inhabited country.&nbsp;
Extensive bogs were in the neighbourhood, connected with the huge
bog of Allan, the Palus M&aelig;otis of Ireland.&nbsp; Here and
there was seen a ruined castle looming through the mists of
winter; whilst, at the distance of seven miles, rose a singular
mountain, exhibiting in its brow a chasm, or vacuum, just, for
all the world, as if a piece had been bitten out; a feat which,
according to the tradition of the country, had actually been
performed by his Satanic majesty, who, after flying for some
leagues with the morsel in his mouth, becoming weary, dropped it
in the vicinity of Cashel, where it may now be seen in the shape
of a bold bluff hill, crowned with the ruins of a stately
edifice, probably built by some ancient Irish king.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>We had been here only a few days, when my brother, who,
as I have before observed, had become one of His Majesty&rsquo;s
officers, was sent on detachment to a village at about ten
miles&rsquo; distance.&nbsp; He was not sixteen, and, though
three years older than myself, scarcely my equal in stature, for
I had become tall and large-limbed for my age; but there was a
spirit in him which would not have disgraced a general; and,
nothing daunted at the considerable responsibility which he was
about to incur, he marched sturdily out of the barrack-yard at
the head of his party, consisting of twenty light infantry men,
and a tall grenadier sergeant, selected expressly by my father,
for the soldier-like qualities which he possessed, to accompany
his son on this his first expedition.&nbsp; So out of the
barrack-yard, with something of an air, marched my dear brother,
his single drum and fife playing the inspiring old melody,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Marlbrouk is gone to the wars,<br />
He&rsquo;ll never return no more!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I soon missed my brother, for I was now alone, with no being,
at all assimilating in age, with whom I could exchange a
word.&nbsp; Of late years, from being almost constantly at
school, I had cast aside, in a great degree, my unsocial habits
and natural reserve, but in the desolate region in which we now
were there was no school; and I felt doubly the loss of my
brother, whom, moreover, I tenderly loved for his own sake.&nbsp;
Books I had none, at least such &ldquo;as I cared about&rdquo;;
and with respect to the old volume, the wonders of which had
first beguiled me into common reading, I had so frequently pored
over its pages, that I had almost got <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>its
contents by heart.&nbsp; I was therefore in danger of falling
into the same predicament as Murtagh, becoming
&ldquo;frighted&rdquo; from having nothing to do!&nbsp; Nay, I
had not even his resources; I cared not for cards, even if I
possessed them, and could find people disposed to play with
them.&nbsp; However, I made the most of circumstances, and roamed
about the desolate fields and bogs in the neighbourhood,
sometimes entering the cabins of the peasantry, with a
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessing upon you, good people!&rdquo; where I
would take my seat on the &ldquo;stranger&rsquo;s stone&rdquo; at
the corner of the hearth, and, looking them full in the face,
would listen to the carles and carlines talking Irish.</p>
<p>Ah, that Irish!&nbsp; How frequently do circumstances, at
first sight the most trivial and unimportant, exercise a mighty
and permanent influence on our habits and pursuits!&mdash;how
frequently is a stream turned aside from its natural course by
some little rock or knoll, causing it to make an abrupt
turn!&nbsp; On a wild road in Ireland I had heard Irish spoken
for the first time; and I was seized with a desire to learn
Irish, the acquisition of which, in my case, became the
stepping-stone to other languages.&nbsp; I had previously learnt
Latin, or rather Lilly; but neither Latin nor Lilly made me a
philologist.&nbsp; I had frequently heard French and other
languages, but had felt little desire to become acquainted with
them; and what, it may be asked, was there connected with the
Irish calculated to recommend it to my attention?</p>
<p>First of all, and principally, I believe, the strangeness and
singularity of its tones; then there was something mysterious and
uncommon associated with its use.&nbsp; It was not a school
language, to acquire <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>which was considered an imperative
duty; no, no; nor was it a drawing-room language, drawled out
occasionally, in shreds and patches, by the ladies of generals
and other great dignitaries, to the ineffable dismay of poor
officers&rsquo; wives.&nbsp; Nothing of the kind; but a speech
spoken in out-of-the-way desolate places, and in cut-throat kens,
where thirty ruffians, at the sight of the king&rsquo;s minions,
would spring up with brandished sticks and an &ldquo;ubbubboo,
like the blowing up of a powder-magazine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were
the points connected with the Irish, which first awakened in my
mind the desire of acquiring it; and by acquiring it I became, as
I have already said, enamoured of languages.&nbsp; Having learnt
one by choice, I speedily, as the reader will perceive, learnt
others, some of which were widely different from Irish.</p>
<p>Ah, that Irish!&nbsp; I am much indebted to it in more ways
than one.&nbsp; But I am afraid I have followed the way of the
world, which is very much wont to neglect original friends and
benefactors.&nbsp; I frequently find myself, at present, turning
up my nose at Irish when I hear it in the street; yet I have
still a kind of regard for it, the fine old language:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A labhair Padruic n&rsquo;insefail nan
riogh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most peculiar features of this part of Ireland is
the ruined castles, which are so thick and numerous that the face
of the country appears studded with them, it being difficult to
choose any situation from which one, at least, may not be
descried.&nbsp; They are of various ages and styles of
architecture, some of great antiquity, like the stately remains
which crown the Crag of Cashel; others <!-- page 108--><a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>built by
the early English conquerors; others, and probably the greater
part, erections of the times of Elizabeth and Cromwell.&nbsp; The
whole speaking monuments of the troubled and insecure state of
the country, from the most remote periods to a comparatively
modern time.</p>
<p>From the windows of the room where I slept I had a view of one
of these old places&mdash;an indistinct one, it is true, the
distance being too great to permit me to distinguish more than
the general outline.&nbsp; I had an anxious desire to explore
it.&nbsp; It stood to the south-east; in which direction,
however, a black bog intervened, which had more than once baffled
all my attempts to cross it.&nbsp; One morning, however, when the
sun shone brightly upon the old building, it appeared so near,
that I felt ashamed at not being able to accomplish a feat
seemingly so easy; I determined, therefore, upon another
trial.&nbsp; I reached the bog, and was about to venture upon its
black surface, and to pick my way amongst its innumerable holes,
yawning horribly, and half filled with water black as soot, when
it suddenly occurred to me that there was a road to the south, by
following which I might find a more convenient route to the
object of my wishes.&nbsp; The event justified my expectations,
for, after following the road for some three miles, seemingly in
the direction of the Devil&rsquo;s Mountain, I suddenly beheld
the castle on my left.</p>
<p>I diverged from the road, and, crossing two or three fields,
came to a small grassy plain, in the midst of which stood the
castle.&nbsp; About a gun-shot to the south was a small village,
which had, probably, in ancient days, sprung up beneath its
protection.&nbsp; A kind of awe came over me as I <!-- page
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>approached the old building.&nbsp; The sun no longer
shone upon it, and it looked so grim, so desolate and solitary;
and here was I, in that wild country, alone with that grim
building before me.&nbsp; The village was within sight, it is
true; but it might be a village of the dead for what I knew; no
sound issued from it, no smoke was rising from its roofs, neither
man nor beast was visible, no life, no motion&mdash;it looked as
desolate as the castle itself.&nbsp; Yet I was bent on the
adventure, and moved on towards the castle across the green
plain, occasionally casting a startled glance around me; and now
I was close to it.</p>
<p>It was surrounded by a quadrangular wall, about ten feet in
height, with a square tower at each corner.&nbsp; At first I
could discover no entrance; walking round, however, to the
northern side, I found a wide and lofty gateway with a tower
above it, similar to those at the angles of the wall; on this
side the ground sloped gently down towards the bog, which was
here skirted by an abundant growth of copsewood, and a few
evergreen oaks.&nbsp; I passed through the gateway, and found
myself within a square enclosure of about two acres.&nbsp; On one
side rose a round and lofty keep, or donjon, with a conical roof,
part of which had fallen down, strewing the square with its
ruins.&nbsp; Close to the keep, on the other side, stood the
remains of an oblong house, built something in the modern style,
with various window-holes; nothing remained but the bare walls
and a few projecting stumps of beams, which seemed to have been
half burnt.&nbsp; The interior of the walls was blackened, as if
by fire; fire also appeared at one time to have raged out of the
window-holes, for the outside about them was <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>black,
portentously so.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder what has been going on
here!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>There were echoes among the walls as I walked about the
court.&nbsp; I entered the keep by a low and frowning doorway:
the lower floor consisted of a large dungeon-like room, with a
vaulted roof; on the left hand was a winding staircase in the
thickness of the wall; it looked anything but inviting; yet I
stole softly up, my heart beating.&nbsp; On the top of the first
flight of stairs was an arched doorway, to the left was a dark
passage, to the right, stairs leading still higher.&nbsp; I
stepped under the arch and found myself in an apartment somewhat
similar to the one below, but higher.&nbsp; There was an object
at the farther end.</p>
<p>An old woman, at least eighty, was seated on a stone, cowering
over a few sticks burning feebly on what had once been a right
noble and cheerful hearth; her side-glance was towards the
doorway as I entered, for she had heard my footsteps.&nbsp; I
stood suddenly still, and her haggard glance rested on my
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your house, mother?&rdquo; I at length
demanded, in the language which I thought she would best
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my house, my own house; the house of the
broken-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any other person&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own house, the beggar&rsquo;s house&mdash;the
accursed house of Cromwell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One morning I set out, designing to pay a visit to my brother,
at the place where he was detached; the distance was rather
considerable, yet I hoped to be back by evening-fall, for I was
now a shrewd walker, thanks to constant practice.&nbsp; I set out
early, and, directing my course towards the north, I had in less
than two hours accomplished considerably more than half of the
journey.&nbsp; The weather had at first been propitious: a slight
frost had rendered the ground firm to the tread, and the skies
were clear; but now a change came over the scene, the skies
darkened, and a heavy snowstorm came on; the road then lay
straight through a bog, and was bounded by a deep trench on both
sides; I was making the best of my way, keeping as nearly as I
could in the middle of the road, lest, blinded by the snow which
was frequently borne into my eyes by the wind, I might fall into
the dyke, when all at once I heard a shout to windward, and
turning my eyes I saw the figure of a <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>man, and
what appeared to be an animal of some kind, coming across the bog
with great speed, in the direction of myself; the nature of the
ground seemed to offer but little impediment to these beings,
both clearing the holes and abysses which lay in their way with
surprising agility; the animal was, however, some slight way in
advance, and, bounding over the dyke, appeared on the road just
before me.&nbsp; It was a dog, of what species I cannot tell,
never having seen the like before or since; the head was large
and round; the ears so tiny as scarcely to be discernible; the
eyes of a fiery red: in size it was rather small than large; and
the coat, which was remarkably smooth, as white as the falling
flakes.&nbsp; It placed itself directly in my path, and showing
its teeth, and bristling its coat, appeared determined to prevent
my progress.&nbsp; I had an ashen stick in my hand, with which I
threatened it; this, however, only served to increase its fury;
it rushed upon me, and I had the utmost difficulty to preserve
myself from its fangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with the dog, the fairy dog?&rdquo;
said a man, who at this time likewise cleared the dyke at a
bound.</p>
<p>He was a very tall man, rather well dressed as it should seem;
his garments, however, were like my own, so covered with snow
that I could scarcely discern their quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are ye doing with the dog of peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would show himself one,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I said nothing to him, but he placed himself in my road,
and would not let me pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he would not be letting you till he knew
where ye were going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not much of a fairy,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;or he <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>would know that without asking; tell
him that I am going to see my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is your brother, little Sas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What my father is, a royal soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ye are going then to the detachment at ---; by my
shoul, I have a good mind to be spoiling your journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are doing that already,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;keeping me here talking about dogs and fairies; you had
better go home and get some salve to cure that place over your
eye; it&rsquo;s catching cold you&rsquo;ll be, in so much
snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one side of the man&rsquo;s forehead there was a raw and
staring wound, as if from a recent and terrible blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, then I&rsquo;ll be going, but it&rsquo;s taking
you wid me I will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where will you take me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, to Ryan&rsquo;s Castle, little
Sas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not speak the language very correctly,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;it is not Sas you should call me&mdash;&rsquo;tis
Sassanach,&rdquo; and forthwith I accompanied the word with a
speech full of flowers of Irish rhetoric.</p>
<p>The man looked upon me for a moment, fixedly, then, bending
his head towards his breast, he appeared to be undergoing a kind
of convulsion, which was accompanied by a sound something
resembling laughter; presently he looked at me, and there was a
broad grin on his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my shoul, it&rsquo;s a thing of peace I&rsquo;m
thinking ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now with a whisking sound came running down the road a
hare; it was nearly upon us before it perceived us; suddenly
stopping short, however, it sprang into the bog on the right-hand
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>side; after it amain bounded the dog of peace, followed
by the man, but not until he had nodded to me a farewell
salutation.&nbsp; In a few moments I lost sight of him amidst the
snowflakes.</p>
<p>The weather was again clear and fine before I reached the
place of detachment.&nbsp; It was a little wooden barrack,
surrounded by a wall of the same material; a sentinel stood at
the gate, I passed by him, and, entering the building, found
myself in a rude kind of guard-room; several soldiers were lying
asleep on a wooden couch at one end, others lounged on benches by
the side of a turf fire.&nbsp; The tall sergeant stood before the
fire, holding a cooking utensil in his left hand; on seeing me,
he made the military salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my brother here?&rdquo; said I, rather timidly,
dreading to hear that he was out, perhaps for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ensign is in his room, sir,&rdquo; said Bagg;
&ldquo;I am now preparing his meal, which will presently be
ready; you will find the ensign above stairs,&rdquo; and he
pointed to a broken ladder which led to some place above.</p>
<p>And there I found him&mdash;the boy soldier&mdash;in a kind of
upper loft, so low that I could touch with my hands the sooty
rafters; the floor was of rough boards, through the joints of
which you could see the gleam of the soldiers&rsquo; fire, and
occasionally discern their figures as they moved about; in one
corner was a camp bedstead, by the side of which hung the
child&rsquo;s sword, gorget, and sash; a deal table stood in the
proximity of the rusty grate, where smoked and smouldered a pile
of black turf from the bog,&mdash;a deal table without a piece of
baize to cover it, yet fraught with things not devoid of <!--
page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>interest: a Bible, given by a mother; the Odyssey, the
Greek Odyssey; a flute, with broad silver keys; crayons,
moreover, and water colours; and a sketch of a wild prospect
near, which, though but half finished, afforded ample proof of
the excellence and skill of the boyish hand now occupied upon
it.</p>
<p>Ah! he was a sweet being, that boy soldier, a plant of early
promise, bidding fair to become in after time all that is great,
good, and admirable.&nbsp; I have read of a remarkable Welshman,
of whom it was said, when the grave closed over him, that he
could frame a harp, and play it; build a ship, and sail it;
compose an ode, and set it to music.&nbsp; A brave fellow that
son of Wales&mdash;but I had once a brother who could do more and
better than this, but the grave has closed over him, as over the
gallant Welshman of yore; there are now but two that remember
him&mdash;the one who bore him, and the being who was nurtured at
the same breast.&nbsp; He was taken, and I was left!&mdash;Truly,
the ways of Providence are inscrutable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be very comfortable, John,&rdquo; said I,
looking around the room and at the various objects which I have
described above: &ldquo;you have a good roof over your head, and
have all your things about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very comfortable, George, in many respects; I
am, moreover, independent, and feel myself a man for the first
time in my life&mdash;independent, did I say?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
not the word, I am something much higher than that; here am I,
not sixteen yet, a person in authority, like the centurion in the
Book there, with twenty Englishmen under me, worth a whole legion
of his men, <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and that fine fellow Bagg to wait
upon me, and take my orders.&nbsp; Oh! these last six weeks have
passed like hours of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your time must frequently hang heavy on your hands;
this is a strange wild place, and you must be very
solitary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am never solitary; I have, as you see, all my things
about me, and there is plenty of company below stairs.&nbsp; Not
that I mix with the soldiers; if I did, goodbye to my authority;
but when I am alone I can hear all their discourse through the
planks, and I often laugh to myself at the funny things they
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you any acquaintance here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best; much better than the Colonel and the
rest, at their grand Templemore; I had never so many in my whole
life before.&nbsp; One has just left me, a gentleman who lives at
a distance across the bog; he comes to talk with me about Greek,
and the Odyssey, for he is a very learned man, and understands
the old Irish, and various other strange languages.&nbsp; He has
had a dispute with Bagg.&nbsp; On hearing his name, he called him
to him, and, after looking at him for some time with great
curiosity, said that he was sure he was a Dane.&nbsp; Bagg,
however, took the compliment in dudgeon, and said that he was no
more a Dane than himself, but a true-born Englishman, and a
sergeant of six years&rsquo; standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what other acquaintance have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All kinds; the whole neighbourhood can&rsquo;t make
enough of me.&nbsp; Amongst others there&rsquo;s the clergyman of
the parish and his family; such a venerable old man, such fine
sons and daughters!&nbsp; I am treated by them like a son and a
brother&mdash;I <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>might be always with them if I
pleased; there&rsquo;s one drawback, however, in going to see
them; there&rsquo;s a horrible creature in the house, a kind of
tutor, whom they keep more from charity than anything else; he is
a Papist and, they say, a priest; you should see him scowl
sometimes at my red coat, for he hates the king, and not
unfrequently, when the king&rsquo;s health is drunk, curses him
between his teeth.&nbsp; I once got up to strike him; but the
youngest of the sisters, who is the handsomest, caught my arm and
pointed to her forehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does your duty consist of?&nbsp; Have you
nothing else to do than pay visits and receive them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do what is required of us: we guard this edifice,
perform our evolutions, and help the excise.&nbsp; I am
frequently called up in the dead of night to go to some wild
place or other in quest of an illicit still; this last part of
our duty is poor mean work; I don&rsquo;t like it, nor more does
Bagg; though without it, we should not see much active service,
for the neighbourhood is quiet; save the poor creatures with
their stills, not a soul is stirring.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true
there&rsquo;s Jerry Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Jerry Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear of him? that&rsquo;s strange; the
whole country is talking about him; he is a kind of outlaw,
rebel, or robber, all three I dare say; there&rsquo;s a hundred
pounds offered for his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His proper home, they say, is in the Queen&rsquo;s
County, where he has a band, but he is a strange fellow, fond of
wandering about by himself amidst the bogs and mountains, and
living in the old <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>castles; occasionally he quarters
himself in the peasants&rsquo; houses, who let him do just what
he pleases; he is free of his money, and often does them good
turns, and can be good-humoured enough, so they don&rsquo;t
dislike him.&nbsp; Then he is what they call a fairy man, a
person in league with fairies and spirits, and able to work much
harm by supernatural means, on which account they hold him in
great awe; he is, moreover, a mighty strong and tall
fellow.&nbsp; Bagg has seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! and felt him; he too is a strange one.&nbsp; A few
days ago he was told that Grant had been seen hovering about an
old castle some two miles off in the bog; so one afternoon what
does he do but, without saying a word to me&mdash;for which, by
the bye, I ought to put him under arrest, though what I should do
without Bagg I have no idea whatever&mdash;what does he do but
walk off to the castle, intending, as I suppose, to pay a visit
to Jerry.&nbsp; He had some difficulty in getting there on
account of the turf-holes in the bog, which he was not accustomed
to; however, thither at last he got and went in.&nbsp; It was a
strange lonesome place, he says, and he did not much like the
look of it; however, in he went, and searched about from the
bottom to the top and down again, but could find no one; he
shouted and hallooed, but nobody answered, save the rooks and
choughs, which started up in great numbers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
lost my trouble,&rsquo; said Bagg, and left the castle.&nbsp; It
was now late in the afternoon, near sunset, when about half way
over the bog he met a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that man was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry Grant! there&rsquo;s no doubt of it.&nbsp; Bagg
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>says it was the most sudden thing in the world.&nbsp;
He was moving along, making the best of his way, thinking of
nothing at all save a public-house at Swanton Morley, which he
intends to take when he gets home, and the regiment is
disbanded&mdash;though I hope that will not be for some time yet:
he had just leaped a turf-hole, and was moving on, when, at the
distance of about six yards before him, he saw a fellow coming
straight towards him.&nbsp; Bagg says that he stopped short, as
suddenly as if he had heard the word halt, when marching at
double quick time.&nbsp; It was quite a surprise, he says, and he
can&rsquo;t imagine how the fellow was so close upon him before
he was aware.&nbsp; He was an immense tall fellow&mdash;Bagg
thinks at least two inches taller than himself&mdash;very well
dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches, for all the world like
a squire when going out hunting.&nbsp; Bagg, however, saw at once
that he had a roguish air, and he was on his guard in a
moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good evening to ye, sodger,&rsquo; says the
fellow, stepping close up to Bagg, and staring him in the
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good evening to you, sir!&nbsp; I hope you are
well,&rsquo; says Bagg.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are looking after some
one?&rsquo; says the fellow.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just so, sir,&rsquo;
says Bagg, and forthwith seized him by the collar; the man
laughed, Bagg says it was such a strange awkward laugh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do you know whom you have got hold of, sodger?&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe I do, sir,&rsquo; said Bagg,
&lsquo;and in that belief will hold you fast in the name of King
George, and the quarter sessions;&rsquo; the next moment he was
sprawling with his heels in the air.&nbsp; Bagg says there was
nothing remarkable in that; he was only flung by a kind of
wrestling trick, which he could easily have baffled, had he been
aware of it.&nbsp; <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>&lsquo;You will not do that again,
sir,&rsquo; said he, as he got up and put himself on his
guard.&nbsp; The fellow laughed again more strangely and
awkwardly than before; then, bending his body and moving his head
from one side to the other as a cat does before she springs, and
crying out, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s for ye, sodger!&rsquo; he made a
dart at Bagg, rushing in with his head foremost.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That will do, sir,&rsquo; says Bagg, and, drawing himself
back, he put in a left-handed blow with all the force of his body
and arm, just over the fellow&rsquo;s right eye.&nbsp; Bagg is a
left-handed hitter, you must know, and it was a blow of that kind
which won him his famous battle at Edinburgh with the big
Highland sergeant.&nbsp; Bagg says that he was quite satisfied
with the blow, more especially when he saw the fellow reel, fling
out his arms, and fall to the ground.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now,
sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make bold to hand you over
to the quarter sessions, and, if there is a hundred pounds for
taking you, who has more right to it than myself?&rsquo;&nbsp; So
he went forward, but ere he could lay hold of his man the other
was again on his legs, and was prepared to renew the
combat.&nbsp; They grappled each other&mdash;Bagg says he had not
much fear of the result, as he now felt himself the best man, the
other seeming half stunned with the blow&mdash;but just then
there came on a blast, a horrible roaring wind bearing night upon
its wings, snow, and sleet, and hail.&nbsp; Bagg says he had the
fellow by the throat quite fast, as he thought, but suddenly he
became bewildered, and knew not where he was; and the man seemed
to melt away from his grasp, and the wind howled more and more,
and the night poured down darker and darker; the snow and the
sleet thicker and more <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>blinding.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lord have mercy upon us!&rsquo;
said Bagg.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; A strange adventure that; it is well that
Bagg got home alive.</p>
<p><i>John</i>.&nbsp; He says that the fight was a fair fight,
and that the fling he got was a fair fling, the result of a
common enough wrestling trick.&nbsp; But with respect to the
storm, which rose up just in time to save the fellow, he is of
opinion that it was not fair, but something Irish and
supernatural.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I dare say he&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; I have
read of witchcraft in the Bible.</p>
<p><i>John</i>.&nbsp; He wishes much to have one more encounter
with the fellow; he says that on fair ground, and in fine
weather, he has no doubt that he could master him, and hand him
over to the quarter sessions.&nbsp; He says that a hundred pounds
would be no bad thing to be disbanded upon; for he wishes to take
an inn at Swanton Morley, keep a cock-pit, and live
respectably.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; He is quite right; and now kiss me, my
darling brother, for I must go back through the bog to
Templemore.</p>

<p>Groom and Cob&mdash;Strength and Symmetry&mdash;Where&rsquo;s
the Saddle?&mdash;The First Ride&mdash;No more Fatigue&mdash;Love
for Horses&mdash;Pursuit of Words&mdash;Philologist and
Pegasus&mdash;The Smith&mdash;What more, Agrah!&mdash;Sassanach
Ten Pence.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that, as I was standing by the door of the
barrack stable, one of the grooms came out to me, saying,
&ldquo;I say, young gentleman, I wish you would give the cob a
breathing this fine morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish me to mount him?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;you know he is dangerous.&nbsp; I saw him fling you off
his back only a few days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the very thing, master.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d rather see anybody on his back than myself; he does not
like me; but, to them he does, he can be as gentle as a
lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that he should not
like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see that, master,&rdquo; said the groom;
&ldquo;and, if so be he shows temper, I will be the first to tell
you to get down.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no fear of that; you
have never angered or insulted him, and to such as you, I say
again, he&rsquo;ll be as gentle as a lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;And how came you to insult him,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;knowing his temper as you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely through forgetfulness, master: I was riding him
about a month ago, and having a stick in my hand, I struck him,
thinking I was on another horse, or rather thinking of nothing at
all.&nbsp; He has never forgiven me, though before that time he
was the only friend I had in the world; I should like to see you
on him, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should soon be off him; I can&rsquo;t
ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are all right, master; there&rsquo;s no
fear.&nbsp; Trust him for not hurting a young gentleman, an
officer&rsquo;s son, who can&rsquo;t ride.&nbsp; If you were a
blackguard dragoon, indeed, with long spurs, &rsquo;twere another
thing; as it is, he&rsquo;ll treat you as if he were the elder
brother that loves you.&nbsp; Ride! he&rsquo;ll soon teach you to
ride if you leave the matter with him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the best
riding master in all Ireland, and the gentlest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cob was led forth; what a tremendous creature!&nbsp; I had
frequently seen him before, and wondered at him; he was barely
fifteen hands, but he had the girth of a metropolitan dray-horse;
his head was small in comparison with his immense neck, which
curved down nobly to his wide back: his chest was broad and fine,
and his shoulders models of symmetry and strength; he stood well
and powerfully upon his legs, which were somewhat short.&nbsp; In
a word, he was a gallant specimen of the genuine Irish cob, a
species at one time not uncommon, but at the present day nearly
extinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the groom, as he looked at him, half
admiringly, half sorrowfully, &ldquo;with sixteen stone on his
back, he&rsquo;ll trot fourteen miles in one hour; with your nine
stone, some two and a half <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>more; ay,
and clear a six-foot wall at the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half afraid,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I had
rather you would ride him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather so, too, if he would let me; but he
remembers the blow.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t be afraid, young
master, he&rsquo;s longing to go out himself.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
been trampling with his feet these three days, and I know what
that means; he&rsquo;ll let anybody ride him but myself, and
thank them; but to me he says, &lsquo;No! you struck
me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the
saddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the saddle; if you are ever to be a frank
rider, you must begin without a saddle; besides, if he felt a
saddle, he would think you don&rsquo;t trust him, and leave you
to yourself.&nbsp; Now, before you mount, make his
acquaintance&mdash;see there, how he kisses you and licks your
face, and see how he lifts his foot, that&rsquo;s to shake
hands.&nbsp; You may trust him&mdash;now you are on his back at
last; mind how you hold the bridle&mdash;gently, gently!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not four pair of hands like yours can hold him if he
wishes to be off.&nbsp; Mind what I tell you&mdash;leave it all
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off went the cob at a slow and gentle trot, too fast and
rough, however, for so inexperienced a rider.&nbsp; I soon felt
myself sliding off, the animal perceived it too, and instantly
stood stone still till I had righted myself; and now the groom
came up: &ldquo;When you feel yourself going,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t lay hold of the mane, that&rsquo;s no use;
mane never yet saved man from falling, no more than straw from
drowning; it&rsquo;s his sides you must cling to with your calves
and feet, till you learn to balance yourself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
it, now abroad with you; I&rsquo;ll bet my <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>comrade a
pot of beer that you&rsquo;ll be a regular rough rider by the
time you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it proved; I followed the directions of the groom, and
the cob gave me every assistance.&nbsp; How easy is riding, after
the first timidity is got over, to supple and youthful limbs; and
there is no second fear.&nbsp; The creature soon found that the
nerves of his rider were in proper tone.&nbsp; Turning his head
half round, he made a kind of whining noise, flung out a little
foam, and set off.</p>
<p>In less than two hours I had made the circuit of the
Devil&rsquo;s Mountain, and was returning along the road, bathed
with perspiration, but screaming with delight; the cob laughing
in his equine way, scattering foam and pebbles to the left and
right, and trotting at the rate of sixteen miles an hour.</p>
<p>Oh, that ride! that first ride!&mdash;most truly it was an
epoch in my existence; and I still look back to it with feelings
of longing and regret.&nbsp; People may talk of first
love&mdash;it is a very agreeable event, I dare say&mdash;but
give me the flush, and triumph, and glorious sweat of a first
ride, like mine on the mighty cob!&nbsp; My whole frame was
shaken, it is true; and during one long week I could hardly move
foot or hand; but what of that?&nbsp; By that one trial I had
become free, as I may say, of the whole equine species.&nbsp; No
more fatigue, no more stiffness of joints, after that first ride
round the Devil&rsquo;s Hill on the cob.</p>
<p>Oh, that cob! that Irish cob!&mdash;may the sod lie lightly
over the bones of the strongest, speediest, and most gallant of
its kind!&nbsp; Oh! the days when, issuing from the barrack-gate
of Templemore, we commenced our hurry-skurry just as inclination
led&mdash;<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>now across the fields&mdash;direct
over stone walls and running brooks&mdash;mere pastime for the
cob!&mdash;sometimes along the road to Thurles and Holy Cross,
even to distant Cahir!&mdash;what was distance to the cob?</p>
<p>It was thus that the passion for the equine race was first
awakened within me&mdash;a passion which, up to the present time,
has been rather on the increase than diminishing.&nbsp; It is no
blind passion; the horse being a noble and generous creature,
intended by the All-Wise to be the helper and friend of man, to
whom he stands next in the order of creation.&nbsp; On many
occasions of my life I have been much indebted to the horse, and
have found in him a friend and coadjutor, when human help and
sympathy were not to be obtained.&nbsp; It is therefore natural
enough that I should love the horse; but the love which I
entertain for him has always been blended with respect; for I
soon perceived that, though disposed to be the friend and helper
of man, he is by no means inclined to be his slave; in which
respect he differs from the dog, who will crouch when beaten;
whereas the horse spurns, for he is aware of his own worth, and
that he carries death within the horn of his heel.&nbsp; If,
therefore, I found it easy to love the horse, I found it equally
natural to respect him.</p>
<p>I much question whether philology, or the passion for
languages, requires so little of an apology as the love for
horses.&nbsp; It has been said, I believe, that the more
languages a man speaks, the more a man is he; which is very true,
provided he acquires languages as a medium for becoming
acquainted with the thoughts and feelings of the various sections
into which the human race is <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>divided;
but, in that case, he should rather be termed a philosopher than
a philologist&mdash;between which two the difference is wide
indeed!&nbsp; An individual may speak and read a dozen languages,
and yet be an exceedingly poor creature, scarcely half a man; and
the pursuit of tongues for their own sake, and the mere
satisfaction of acquiring them, surely argues an intellect of a
very low order; a mind disposed to be satisfied with mean and
grovelling things; taking more pleasure in the trumpery casket
than in the precious treasure which it contains; in the pursuit
of words, than in the acquisition of ideas.</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking that it was fortunate for myself, who
am, to a certain extent, a philologist, that with me the pursuit
of languages has been always modified by the love of horses; for
scarcely had I turned my mind to the former, when I also mounted
the wild cob, and hurried forth in the direction of the
Devil&rsquo;s Hill, scattering dust and flint-stones on every
side; that ride, amongst other things, taught me that a lad with
thews and sinews was intended by nature for something better than
mere word-culling; and if I have accomplished anything in after
life worthy of mentioning, I believe it may partly be attributed
to the ideas which that ride, by setting my blood in a glow,
infused into my brain.&nbsp; I might, otherwise, have become a
mere philologist; one of those beings who toil night and day in
culling useless words for some <i>opus magnum</i> which Murray
will never publish, and nobody ever read; beings without
enthusiasm, who, having never mounted a generous steed, cannot
detect a good point in Pegasus himself; like a certain
philologist, who, though acquainted <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>with the
exact value of every word in the Greek and Latin languages, could
observe no particular beauty in one of the most glorious of
Homer&rsquo;s rhapsodies.&nbsp; What knew he of Pegasus? he had
never mounted a generous steed; the merest jockey, had the strain
been interpreted to him, would have called it a brave
song!&mdash;I return to the brave cob.</p>
<p>On a certain day I had been out on an excursion.&nbsp; In a
cross-road, at some distance from the Satanic hill, the animal
which I rode cast a shoe.&nbsp; By good luck a small village was
at hand, at the entrance of which was a large shed, from which
proceeded a most furious noise of hammering.&nbsp; Leading the
cob by the bridle, I entered boldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shoe this
horse, and do it quickly, a gough,&rdquo; said I to a wild grimy
figure of a man, whom I found alone, fashioning a piece of
iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrigod yuit?&rdquo; said the fellow, desisting from
his work, and staring at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I have money,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and of the
best;&rdquo; and I pulled out an English shilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabhair chugam?&rdquo; said the smith, stretching out
his grimy hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;some people
are glad to get their money when their work is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow hammered a little longer, and then proceeded to
shoe the cob, after having first surveyed it with
attention.&nbsp; He performed his job rather roughly, and more
than once appeared to give the animal unnecessary pain,
frequently making use of loud and boisterous words.&nbsp; By the
time the work was done, the creature was in a state of high
excitement, and plunged and tore.&nbsp; The smith stood at a
short distance, seeming to enjoy the <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>irritation
of the animal, and showing, in a remarkable manner, a huge fang,
which projected from the under jaw of a very wry mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deserve better handling,&rdquo; said I, as I went
up to the cob and fondled it; whereupon it whinnied, and
attempted to touch my face with its nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye not afraid of that beast?&rdquo; said the smith,
showing his fang.&nbsp; &ldquo;Arrah, it&rsquo;s vicious that he
looks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at you, then!&mdash;I don&rsquo;t fear
him;&rdquo; and thereupon I passed under the horse, between its
hind legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that all you can do, agrah?&rdquo; said the
smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I can ride him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can ride him, and what else, agrah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can leap him over a six-foot wall,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over a wall, and what more, agrah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what more would you
have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you do this, agrah?&rdquo; said the smith; and he
uttered a word which I had never heard before, in a sharp pungent
tone.&nbsp; The effect upon myself was somewhat extraordinary, a
strange thrill ran through me; but with regard to the cob it was
terrible; the animal forthwith became like one mad, and reared
and kicked with the utmost desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you do that, agrah?&rdquo; said the smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said I, retreating; &ldquo;I never
saw the horse so before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go between his legs, agrah,&rdquo; said the smith,
&ldquo;his hinder legs;&rdquo; and he again showed his fang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he would kill
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;He would kill ye! and how do ye know that,
agrah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel he would,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;something tells
me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it tells ye truth, agrah; but it&rsquo;s a fine
beast, and it&rsquo;s a pity to see him in such a state: Is agam
an&rsquo;t leigeas&rdquo;&mdash;and here he uttered another word
in a voice singularly modified, but sweet and almost plaintive;
the effect of it was as instantaneous as that of the other, but
how different!&mdash;the animal lost all its fury, and became at
once calm and gentle.&nbsp; The smith went up to it, coaxed and
patted it, making use of various sounds of equal endearment; then
turning to me, and holding out once more the grimy hand, he said,
&ldquo;And now ye will be giving me the Sassanach ten pence,
agrah?&rdquo;</p>

longer in Ireland, but in the eastern corner of merry
England.&nbsp; Bogs, ruins, and mountains have disappeared amidst
the vapours of the west: I have nothing more to say of them; the
region in which we are now is not famous for objects of that
kind: perhaps it flatters itself that it can produce fairer and
better things, of some of which let me speak; there is a fine old
city before us, and first of that let me speak. <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a></p>
<p>A fine old city, truly, is that, view it from whatever side
you will; but it shows best from the east, where the ground, bold
and elevated, overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it
stands.&nbsp; Gazing from those heights, the eye beholds a scene
which cannot fail to awaken, even in the least <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>sensitive
bosom, feelings of pleasure and admiration.&nbsp; At the foot of
the heights flows a narrow and deep river, with an antique bridge
communicating with a long and narrow suburb, flanked on either
side by rich meadows of the brightest green, beyond which spreads
the city; the fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at
present extant of the genuine old English town.&nbsp; Yes, there
it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its
numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound,
which, if tradition speaks true, was raised by human hands to
serve as the grave heap of an old heathen king, who sits deep
within it, with his sword in his hand, and his gold and silver
treasures about him.&nbsp; There is a grey old castle <a
name="citation132a"></a><a href="#footnote132a"
class="citation">[132a]</a> upon the top of that mighty mound;
and yonder, rising three hundred feet above the soil, from among
those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, <a
name="citation132b"></a><a href="#footnote132b"
class="citation">[132b]</a> that cloud-encircled cathedral spire,
around which a garrulous army of rooks and choughs continually
wheel their flight.&nbsp; Now, who can wonder that the children
of that fine old city are proud of her, and offer up prayers for
her prosperity?&nbsp; I, myself, who was not born within her
walls, offer up prayers for her prosperity, that want may never
visit her cottages, vice her palaces, and that the abomination of
idolatry may never pollute her temples.&nbsp; Ha, idolatry! the
reign of idolatry has been over there for many a long year, never
more, let us hope, to return; brave hearts in that old <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>town have borne witness against it, and sealed their
testimony with their hearts&rsquo; blood&mdash;most precious to
the Lord is the blood of His saints! we are not far from hallowed
ground.&nbsp; Observe ye not yon chalky precipice, to the right
of the Norman bridge? <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a>&nbsp; On this side
of the stream, upon its brow, is a piece of ruined wall, the last
relic of what was of old a stately pile, whilst at its foot is a
place called the Lollards&rsquo; Hole; and with good reason, for
many a saint of God has breathed his last beneath that white
precipice, bearing witness against popish idolatry, midst flame
and pitch; many a grisly procession has advanced along that
suburb, across the old bridge, towards the Lollards&rsquo; Hole:
furious priests in front, a calm pale martyr in the midst, a
pitying multitude behind.&nbsp; It has had its martyrs, the
venerable old town!</p>
<p>Ah! there is good blood in that old city, and in the whole
circumjacent region of which it is the capital.&nbsp; The Angles
possessed the land at an early period, which, however, they were
eventually compelled to share with hordes of Danes and Northmen,
who flocked thither across the sea to found hearthsteads on its
fertile soil.&nbsp; The present race, a mixture of Angles and
Danes, still preserve much which speaks strongly of their
northern ancestry; amongst them ye will find the light brown hair
of the north, the strong and burly forms of the north, many a
wild superstition, ay, and many a wild name connected with the
ancient history of the north and its sublime mythology; the warm
heart, and the strong heart of the old Danes and Saxons still
beats in those regions, and there ye will find, if anywhere, old
northern <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>hospitality and kindness of manner,
united with energy, perseverance, and dauntless intrepidity;
better soldiers or mariners never bled in their country&rsquo;s
battles than those nurtured in those regions, and within those
old walls.&nbsp; It was yonder, to the west, that the great naval
hero of Britain first saw the light; <a name="citation134"></a><a
href="#footnote134" class="citation">[134]</a> he who annihilated
the sea pride of Spain, and dragged the humbled banner of France
in triumph at his stern.&nbsp; He was born yonder, towards the
west, and of him there is a glorious relic in that old town; in
its dark flint guildhouse, the roof of which you can just descry
rising above that maze of buildings, in the upper hall of
justice, is a species of glass shrine, in which the relic is to
be seen: a sword of curious workmanship, the blade is of keen
Toledan steel, the heft of ivory and mother-of-pearl.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the sword of Cordova, won in bloodiest fray off Saint
Vincent&rsquo;s promontory, and presented by Nelson to the old
capital of the much-loved land of his birth.&nbsp; Yes, the proud
Spaniard&rsquo;s sword is to be seen in yonder guildhouse, in the
glass case affixed to the wall: many other relics has the good
old town, but none prouder than the Spaniard&rsquo;s sword.</p>
<p>Such was the place to which, when the war was over, my father
retired: it was here that the old tired soldier set himself down
with his little family.&nbsp; He had passed the greater part of
his life in meritorious exertion, in the service of his country,
and his chief wish now was to spend the remainder of his days in
quiet and respectability; his means, it is true, were not very
ample; fortunate it was that his desires corresponded with them:
with a small <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>fortune of his own, and with his
half-pay as a royal soldier, he had no fears for himself or for
his faithful partner and helpmate; but then his children! how was
he to provide for them? how launch them upon the wide ocean of
the world?&nbsp; This was, perhaps, the only thought which gave
him uneasiness, and I believe that many an old retired officer at
that time, and under similar circumstances, experienced similar
anxiety; had the war continued, their children would have been,
of course, provided for in the army, but peace now reigned, and
the military career was closed to all save the scions of the
aristocracy, or those who were in some degree connected with that
privileged order, an advantage which few of these old officers
could boast of; they had slight influence with the great, who
gave themselves very little trouble either about them or their
families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been writing to the Duke,&rdquo; said my father
one day to my excellent mother, after we had been at home
somewhat better than a year.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been writing to
the Duke of York about a commission for that eldest boy of
ours.&nbsp; He, however, affords me no hopes; he says that his
list is crammed with names, and that the greater number of the
candidates have better claims than my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see how that can be,&rdquo; said my
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; replied my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see
the sons of bankers and merchants gazetted every month, and I do
not see what claims they have to urge, unless they be golden
ones.&nbsp; However, I have not served my king fifty years to
turn grumbler at this time of life.&nbsp; I suppose that the
people at the head of affairs know what is most proper and
convenient; perhaps when the lad sees how difficult, <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>nay, how impossible it is that he should enter the
army, he will turn his mind to some other profession; I wish he
may!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he has already,&rdquo; said my mother;
&ldquo;you see how fond he is of the arts, of drawing and
painting, and, as far as I can judge, what he has already done is
very respectable; his mind seems quite turned that way, and I
heard him say the other day that he would sooner be a Michael
Angelo than a general officer.&nbsp; But you are always talking
of him; what do you think of doing with the other
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, indeed!&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;that is a
consideration which gives me no little uneasiness.&nbsp; I am
afraid it will be much more difficult to settle him in life than
his brother.&nbsp; What is he fitted for, even were it in my
power to provide for him?&nbsp; God help the child!&nbsp; I bear
him no ill will, on the contrary, all love and affection; but I
cannot shut my eyes; there is something so strange about
him!&nbsp; How he behaved in Ireland!&nbsp; I sent him to school
to learn Greek, and he picked up Irish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Greek as well,&rdquo; said my mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I heard him say the other day that he could read St. John
in the original tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find excuses for him, I know,&rdquo; said my
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;You tell me I am always talking of my
first-born; I might retort by saying you are always thinking of
the other; but it is the way of women always to side with the
second-born.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s her name in the
Bible, by whose wiles the old blind man was induced to give to
his second son the blessing which was the birthright of the
other.&nbsp; I wish I had been in his place!&nbsp; I should not
have been so easily deceived! no disguise <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>would ever
have caused me to mistake an impostor for my first-born.&nbsp;
Though I must say for this boy that he is nothing like Jacob; he
is neither smooth nor sleek, and, though my second-born, is
already taller and larger than his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said my mother; &ldquo;his brother
would make a far better Jacob than he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will hear nothing against my first-born,&rdquo; said
my father, &ldquo;even in the way of insinuation: he is my joy
and pride; the very image of myself in my youthful days, long
before I fought Big Ben; though perhaps not quite so tall or
strong built.&nbsp; As for the other, God bless the child!&nbsp;
I love him, I&rsquo;m sure; but I must be blind not to see the
difference between him and his brother.&nbsp; Why, he has neither
my hair nor my eyes; and then his countenance! why, &rsquo;tis
absolutely swarthy, God forgive me! I had almost said like that
of a gypsy, but I have nothing to say against that; the boy is
not to be blamed for the colour of his face, nor for his hair and
eyes; but, then, his ways and manners!&mdash;I confess I do not
like them, and that they give me no little uneasiness&mdash;I
know that he kept very strange company when he was in Ireland;
people of evil report, of whom terrible things were
said&mdash;horse-witches and the like.&nbsp; I questioned him
once or twice upon the matter, and even threatened him, but it
was of no use; he put on a look as if he did not understand me, a
regular Irish look, just such a one as those rascals assume when
they wish to appear all innocence and simplicity, and they full
of malice and deceit all the time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like them;
they are no friends to old England, or its old king, God bless
him!&nbsp; They are not good subjects, and never were; always in
league with <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>foreign enemies.&nbsp; When I was in
the Coldstream, long before the Revolution, I used to hear enough
about the Irish brigades kept by the French kings, to be a thorn
in the side of the English whenever opportunity served.&nbsp; Old
Sergeant Meredith once told me, that in the time of the Pretender
there were always, in London alone, a dozen of fellows connected
with these brigades, with the view of seducing the king&rsquo;s
soldiers from their allegiance, and persuading them to desert to
France to join the honest Irish, as they were called.&nbsp; One
of these traitors once accosted him and proposed the matter to
him, offering handfuls of gold if he could induce any of his
comrades to go over.&nbsp; Meredith appeared to consent; but
secretly gave information to his colonel; the fellow was seized,
and certain traitorous papers found upon him; he was hanged
before Newgate, and died exulting in his treason.&nbsp; His name
was Michael Nowlan.&nbsp; That ever son of mine should have been
intimate with the Papist Irish, and have learnt their
language!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he thinks of other things now,&rdquo; said my
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other languages, you mean,&rdquo; said my father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is strange that he has conceived such a zest for the
study of languages; no sooner did he come home than he persuaded
me to send him to that old priest to learn French and Italian,
and, if I remember right, you abetted him; but, as I said before,
it is in the nature of women invariably to take the part of the
second-born.&nbsp; Well, there is no harm in learning French and
Italian, perhaps much good in his case, as they may drive the
other tongue out of his head.&nbsp; Irish! why he might go to the
university but for that; but how would he <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>look when,
on being examined with respect to his attainments, it was
discovered that he understood Irish?&nbsp; How did you learn it?
they would ask him; how did you become acquainted with the
language of Papists and rebels?&nbsp; The boy would be sent away
in disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be under no apprehension; I have no doubt that he has
long since forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said my father;
&ldquo;for, between ourselves, I love the poor child; ay, quite
as well as my first-born.&nbsp; I trust they will do well, and
that God will be their shield and guide; I have no doubt He will,
for I have read something in the Bible to that effect.&nbsp; What
is that text about the young ravens being fed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a better than that,&rdquo; said my mother;
&ldquo;one of David&rsquo;s own words, &lsquo;I have been young
and now am grown old, yet never have I seen the righteous man
forsaken, or his seed begging their bread.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have heard talk of the pleasures of idleness, yet it is my
own firm belief that no one ever yet took pleasure in it.&nbsp;
Mere idleness is the most disagreeable state of existence, and
both mind and body are continually making efforts to escape from
it.&nbsp; It has been said that idleness is the parent of
mischief, which is very true; but mischief itself is merely an
attempt to escape from the dreary vacuum of idleness.&nbsp; There
are many tasks and occupations which a man is unwilling to
perform, but let no one think that he is therefore in love with
idleness; he turns to something which is more agreeable to his
inclination, and doubtless more suited to his nature; but he is
not in love with idleness.&nbsp; A boy may play the truant from
school because he dislikes <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>books and
study; but, depend upon it, he intends doing something the
while&mdash;to go fishing, or perhaps to take a walk; and who
knows but that from such excursions both his mind and body may
derive more benefit than from books and school?&nbsp; Many people
go to sleep to escape from idleness; the Spaniards do; and,
according to the French account, John Bull, the squire, hangs
himself in the month of November; but the French, who are a very
sensible people, attribute the action, &ldquo;<i>&agrave; une
grande envie de se d&eacute;sennuyer</i>;&rdquo; he wishes to be
doing something, say they, and having nothing better to do, he
has recourse to the cord.</p>
<p>It was for want of something better to do that, shortly after
my return home, <a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140"
class="citation">[140]</a> I applied myself to the study of
languages.&nbsp; By the acquisition of Irish, with the first
elements of which I had become acquainted under the tuition of
Murtagh, I had contracted a certain zest and inclination for the
pursuit.&nbsp; Yet it is probable, that had I been launched about
this time into some agreeable career, that of arms, for example,
for which, being the son of a soldier, I had, as was natural, a
sort of penchant, I might have thought nothing more of the
acquisition of tongues of any kind; but, having nothing to do, I
followed the only course suited to my genius which appeared open
to me.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that one day, whilst wandering listlessly
about the streets of the old town, I came to a small bookstall,
and stopping, commenced <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>turning
over the books; I took up at least a dozen, and almost instantly
flung them down.&nbsp; What were they to me?&nbsp; At last,
coming to a thick volume, I opened it, and after inspecting its
contents for a few minutes, I paid for it what was demanded, and
forthwith carried it home.</p>
<p>It was a tessara-glot grammar; a strange old book, printed
somewhere in Holland, which pretended to be an easy guide to the
acquirement of the French, Italian, Low Dutch, and English
tongues, by means of which any one conversant in any one of these
languages could make himself master of the other three.&nbsp; I
turned my attention to the French and Italian.&nbsp; The old book
was not of much value; I derived some benefit from it, however,
and, conning it intensely, at the end of a few weeks obtained
some insight into the structure of these two languages.&nbsp; At
length I had learnt all that the book was capable of informing
me, yet was still far from the goal to which it had promised to
conduct me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I had a master!&rdquo; I
exclaimed; and the master was at hand.&nbsp; In an old court of
the old town lived a certain elderly personage, perhaps sixty, or
thereabouts; he was rather tall, and something of a robust make,
with a countenance in which bluffness was singularly blended with
vivacity and grimace; and with a complexion which would have been
ruddy, but for a yellow hue which rather predominated.&nbsp; His
dress consisted of a snuff-coloured coat and drab pantaloons, the
former evidently seldom subjected to the annoyance of a brush,
and the latter exhibiting here and there spots of something
which, if not grease, bore a strong resemblance to it; add to
these articles an immense frill, seldom of the purest white, but
invariably of <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>the finest French cambric, and you
have some idea of his dress.&nbsp; He had rather a remarkable
stoop, but his step was rapid and vigorous, and as he hurried
along the streets, he would glance to the right and left with a
pair of big eyes like plums, and on recognising any one would
exalt a pair of grizzled eyebrows, and slightly kiss a tawny and
ungloved hand.&nbsp; At certain hours of the day he might be seen
entering the doors of female boarding-schools, generally with a
book in his hand, and perhaps another just peering from the
orifice of a capacious back pocket; and at a certain season of
the year he might be seen, dressed in white, before the altar of
a certain small popish chapel, chanting from the breviary in very
intelligible Latin, or perhaps reading from the desk in utterly
unintelligible English.&nbsp; Such was my preceptor in the French
and Italian tongues.&nbsp; &ldquo;Exul sacerdos; vone banished
priest.&nbsp; I came into England twenty-five year ago, &lsquo;my
dear.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a></p>
<h2><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Monsieur Dante&mdash;Condemned
Musket&mdash;Sporting&mdash;Sweet Rivulet&mdash;The Earl&rsquo;s
Home&mdash;The Pool&mdash;The Sonorous Voice&mdash;What dost Thou
Read?&mdash;Man of Peace&mdash;Zohar and
Mishna&mdash;Money-changers.</p>
<p>So I studied French and Italian under the tuition of the
banished priest, to whose house I went regularly every evening to
receive instruction.&nbsp; I made considerable progress in the
acquisition of the two languages.&nbsp; I found the French by far
the most difficult, chiefly on account of the accent, which my
master himself possessed in no great purity, being a Norman by
birth.&nbsp; The Italian was my favourite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Vous serez</i> <i>un jour un grand philologue</i>,
<i>mon cher</i>,&rdquo; said the old man, on our arriving at the
conclusion of Dante&rsquo;s Hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall be something better,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;before I die, or I shall have lived to little
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, my dear! philologist&mdash;one small
poor dog.&nbsp; What would you wish to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things sooner than that; for example, I would
rather be like him who wrote this book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quoi</i>, <i>Monsieur Dante</i>?&nbsp; He was a
vagabond, my dear, forced to fly from his country.&nbsp; No, my
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>dear, if you would be like one poet, be like Monsieur
Boileau; he is the poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, not think so?&nbsp; He wrote very respectable
verses; lived and died much respected by everybody.&nbsp;
T&rsquo;other, one bad dog, forced to fly from his
country&mdash;died with not enough to pay his
undertaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you not forced to flee from your
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That very true; but there is much difference between me
and this Dante.&nbsp; He fled from country because he had one bad
tongue which he shook at his betters.&nbsp; I fly because
benefice gone, and head going; not on account of the badness of
my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you can return now; the
Bourbons are restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find myself very well here; not bad country.&nbsp;
<i>Il est vrai que la France sera toujours la France</i>; but all
are dead there who knew me.&nbsp; I find myself very well
here.&nbsp; Preach in popish chapel, teach schismatic, that is
Protestant, child tongues and literature.&nbsp; I find myself
very well; and why?&nbsp; Because I know how to govern my tongue;
never call people hard names.&nbsp; <i>Ma foi</i>, <i>il y a
beaucoup de diff&eacute;rence entre moi et ce sacre de
Dante</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under this old man, who was well versed in the southern
languages, besides studying French and Italian, I acquired some
knowledge of Spanish.&nbsp; But I did not devote my time entirely
to philology; I had other pursuits.&nbsp; I had not forgotten the
roving life I had led in former days, nor its delights; neither
was I formed by nature to be a pallid indoor student.&nbsp; No,
no!&nbsp; I was fond of <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>other and,
I say it boldly, better things than study.&nbsp; I had an
attachment to the angle, ay, and to the gun likewise.&nbsp; In
our house was a condemned musket, bearing somewhere on its lock,
in rather antique characters, &ldquo;Tower, 1746&rdquo;; with
this weapon I had already, in Ireland, performed some execution
among the rooks and choughs, and it was now again destined to be
a source of solace and amusement to me, in the winter season,
especially on occasions of severe frost when birds
abounded.&nbsp; Sallying forth with it at these times, far into
the country, I seldom returned at night without a string of
bullfinches, blackbirds, and linnets hanging in triumph round my
neck.&nbsp; When I reflect on the immense quantity of powder and
shot which I crammed down the muzzle of my uncouth fowling-piece,
I am less surprised at the number of birds which I slaughtered,
than that I never blew my hands, face, and old honey-combed gun,
at one and the same time, to pieces.</p>
<p>But the winter, alas! (I speak as a fowler) seldom lasts in
England more than three or four months; so, during the rest of
the year, when not occupied with my philological studies, I had
to seek for other diversions.&nbsp; I have already given a hint
that I was also addicted to the angle.&nbsp; Of course there is
no comparison between the two pursuits, the rod and line seeming
but very poor trumpery to one who has had the honour of carrying
a noble firelock.&nbsp; There is a time, however, for all things;
and we return to any favourite amusement with the greater zest,
from being compelled to relinquish it for a season.&nbsp; So, if
I shot birds in winter with my firelock, I caught fish in summer,
or attempted so to do, with my <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>angle.&nbsp; I was not quite so successful, it is true,
with the latter as with the former; possibly because it afforded
me less pleasure.&nbsp; It was, indeed, too much of a listless
pastime to inspire me with any great interest.&nbsp; I not
unfrequently fell into a doze, whilst sitting on the bank, and
more than once let my rod drop from my hands into the water.</p>
<p>At some distance from the city, behind a range of hilly ground
which rises towards the south-west, is a small river, the waters
of which, after many meanderings, eventually enter the principal
river of the district, <a name="citation146"></a><a
href="#footnote146" class="citation">[146]</a> and assist to
swell the tide which it rolls down to the ocean.&nbsp; It is a
sweet rivulet, and pleasant is it to trace its course from its
spring-head, high up in the remote regions of Eastern Anglia,
till it arrives in the valley behind yon rising ground; and
pleasant is that valley, truly a goodly spot, but most lovely
where yonder bridge crosses the little stream.&nbsp; Beneath its
arch the waters rush garrulously into a blue pool, and are there
stilled, for a time, for the pool is deep, and they appear to
have sunk to sleep.&nbsp; Farther on, however, you hear their
voice again, where they ripple gaily over yon gravelly
shallow.&nbsp; On the left, the hill slopes gently down to the
margin of the stream.&nbsp; On the right is a green level, a
smiling meadow, grass of the richest decks the side of the slope;
mighty trees also adorn it, giant elms, the nearest of which,
when the sun is nigh its meridian, fling a broad shadow upon the
face of the pool; through yon vista you catch a glimpse of the
ancient brick of an old English hall.&nbsp; It has a stately
look, that old building, indistinctly <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>seen, as it
is, among those umbrageous trees; you might almost suppose it an
earl&rsquo;s home; and such it was, or rather upon its site stood
an earl&rsquo;s home, in days of old, for there some old Kemp,
some Sigurd, or Thorkild, roaming in quest of a hearth-stead,
settled down in the grey old time, when Thor and Freya were yet
gods, and Odin was a portentous name.&nbsp; Yon old hall is still
called the Earl&rsquo;s Home, <a name="citation147"></a><a
href="#footnote147" class="citation">[147]</a> though the hearth
of Sigurd is now no more, and the bones of the old Kemp, and of
Sigrith his dame, have been mouldering for a thousand years in
some neighbouring knoll; perhaps yonder, where those tall
Norwegian pines shoot up so boldly into the air.&nbsp; It is said
that the old earl&rsquo;s galley was once moored where is now
that blue pool, for the waters of that valley were not always
sweet; yon valley was once an arm of the sea, a salt lagoon, to
which the war-barks of &ldquo;Sigurd, in search of a home,&rdquo;
found their way.</p>
<p>I was in the habit of spending many an hour on the banks of
that rivulet, with my rod in my hand, and, when tired with
angling, would stretch myself on the grass, and gaze upon the
waters as they glided past, and not unfrequently, divesting
myself of my dress, I would plunge into the deep pool which I
have already mentioned, for I had long since learned to
swim.&nbsp; And it came to pass, that on one hot summer&rsquo;s
day, after bathing in the pool, I passed along the meadow till I
came to a shallow part, and, wading over to the opposite side, I
adjusted my dress, and commenced fishing in another pool, beside
which was a small clump of hazels.</p>

148</span>And there I sat upon the bank, at the bottom of the
hill which slopes down from &ldquo;the Earl&rsquo;s home&rdquo;;
my float was on the waters, and my back was towards the old
hall.&nbsp; I drew up many fish, small and great, which I took
from off the hook mechanically, and flung upon the bank, for I
was almost unconscious of what I was about, for my mind was not
with my fish.&nbsp; I was thinking of my earlier years&mdash;of
the Scottish crags and the heaths of Ireland&mdash;and sometimes
my mind would dwell on my studies&mdash;on the sonorous stanzas
of Dante, rising and falling like the waves of the sea&mdash;or
would strive to remember a couplet or two of poor Monsieur
Boileau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou answer to thy conscience for pulling all
those fish out of the water, and leaving them to gasp in the
sun?&rdquo; said a voice, clear and sonorous as a bell.</p>
<p>I started, and looked round.&nbsp; Close behind me stood the
tall figure of a man, dressed in raiment of quaint and singular
fashion, but of goodly materials.&nbsp; He was in the prime and
vigour of manhood; his features handsome and noble, but full of
calmness and benevolence; at least I thought so, though they were
somewhat shaded by a hat of finest beaver, with broad drooping
eaves. <a name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that is a very cruel diversion in which thou
indulgest, my young friend?&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it, if it be, sir,&rdquo; said I,
rising; &ldquo;but I do not think it cruel to fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are thy reasons for not thinking so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;Fishing is mentioned frequently in
Scripture.&nbsp; Simon Peter was a fisherman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; and Andrew and his brother.&nbsp; But thou
forgettest: they did not follow fishing as a diversion, as I fear
thou doest.&mdash;Thou readest the Scriptures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes?&mdash;not daily?&mdash;that is to be
regretted.&nbsp; What profession dost thou make?&mdash;I mean to
what religious denomination dost thou belong, my young
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very good profession&mdash;there is much of
Scripture contained in its liturgy.&nbsp; Dost thou read aught
besides the Scriptures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou read besides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greek, and Dante.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! then thou hast the advantage over myself; I can
only read the former.&nbsp; Well, I am rejoiced to find that thou
hast other pursuits beside thy fishing.&nbsp; Dost thou know
Hebrew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shouldst study it.&nbsp; Why dost thou not
undertake the study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lend thee books, if thou wish to undertake the
study.&nbsp; I live yonder at the hall, as perhaps thou
knowest.&nbsp; I have a library there, in which are many curious
books, both in Greek and Hebrew, which I will show to thee,
whenever thou mayest find it convenient to come and see me.&nbsp;
Farewell!&nbsp; I am glad to find that thou hast pursuits more
satisfactory than thy cruel fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man of peace departed, and left me on <!-- page
150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>the bank of the stream.&nbsp; Whether from the effect
of his words, or from want of inclination to the sport, I know
not, but from that day I became less and less a practitioner of
that &ldquo;cruel fishing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I rarely flung line and
angle into the water, but I not unfrequently wandered by the
banks of the pleasant rivulet.&nbsp; It seems singular to me, on
reflection, that I never availed myself of his kind
invitation.&nbsp; I say singular, for the extraordinary, under
whatever form, had long had no slight interest for me; and I had
discernment enough to perceive that yon was no common man.&nbsp;
Yet I went not near him, certainly not from bashfulness, or
timidity, feelings to which I had long been an entire
stranger.&nbsp; Am I to regret this? perhaps, for I might have
learned both wisdom and righteousness from those calm, quiet
lips, and my after-course might have been widely different.&nbsp;
As it was, I fell in with other guess companions, from whom I
received widely different impressions than those I might have
derived from him.&nbsp; When many years had rolled on, long after
I had attained manhood, and had seen and suffered much, and when
our first interview had long since been effaced from the mind of
the man of peace, I visited him in his venerable hall, and
partook of the hospitality of his hearth.&nbsp; And there I saw
his gentle partner, and his fair children, and on the morrow he
showed me the books of which he had spoken years before, by the
side of the stream.&nbsp; In the low quiet chamber, whose one
window, shaded by a gigantic elm, looks down the slope towards
the pleasant stream, he took from the shelf his learned books,
Zohar and Mishna, Toldoth Jesu and Abarbenel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
fond of these studies,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which, <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>perhaps, is not to be wondered at, seeing that our
people have been compared to the Jews.&nbsp; In one respect I
confess we are similar to them; we are fond of getting
money.&nbsp; I do not like this last author, this Abarbenel, the
worse for having been a money-changer.&nbsp; I am a banker
myself, as thou knowest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And would there were many like him, amidst the money-changers
of princes!&nbsp; The hall of many an earl lacks the bounty, the
palace of many a prelate the piety and learning, which adorn the
quiet Quaker&rsquo;s home!</p>

<p>Fair of Horses&mdash;Looks of Respect&mdash;The Fast
Trotter&mdash;Pair of Eyes&mdash;Strange Men&mdash;Jasper, Your
Pal&mdash;Force of Blood&mdash;Young Lady with Diamonds&mdash;Not
Quite so Beautiful.</p>
<p>I was standing on the Castle Hill in the midst of a fair of
horses.</p>
<p>I have already had occasion to mention this castle.&nbsp; It
is the remains of what was once a Norman stronghold, and is
perched upon a round mound or monticle, in the midst of the old
city.&nbsp; Steep is this mound and scarped, evidently by the
hand of man; a deep gorge, over which is flung a bridge,
separates it, on the south, from a broad swell of open ground
called &ldquo;the hill&rdquo;; of old the scene of many a
tournament and feat of Norman chivalry, but now much used as a
show-place for cattle, where those who buy and sell beeves and
other beasts resort at stated periods.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that I stood upon this hill, observing a
fair of horses. <a name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a></p>
<p>The reader is already aware that I had long since conceived a
passion for the equine race; a passion in which circumstances had
of late not <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>permitted me to indulge.&nbsp; I had
no horses to ride, but I took pleasure in looking at them; and I
had already attended more than one of these fairs: the present
was lively enough, indeed horse fairs are seldom dull.&nbsp;
There was shouting and whooping, neighing and braying; there was
galloping and trotting; fellows with highlows and white
stockings, and with many a string dangling from the knees of
their tight breeches, were running desperately, holding horses by
the halter, and in some cases dragging them along; there were
long-tailed steeds, and dock-tailed steeds of every degree and
breed; there were droves of wild ponies, and long rows of sober
cart horses; there were donkeys, and even mules: the last rare
things to be seen in damp, misty England, for the mule pines in
mud and rain, and thrives best with a hot sun above and a burning
sand below.&nbsp; There were&mdash;oh, the gallant
creatures!&nbsp; I hear their neigh upon the wind; there
were&mdash;goodliest sight of all&mdash;certain enormous
quadrupeds only seen to perfection in our native isle, led about
by dapper grooms, their manes ribanded and their tails curiously
clubbed and balled.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&mdash;how distinctly do they
say, ha! ha!</p>
<p>An old man draws nigh, he is mounted on a lean pony, and he
leads by the bridle one of these animals; nothing very remarkable
about that creature, unless in being smaller than the rest and
gentle, which they are not; he is not of the sightliest look; he
is almost dun, and over one eye a thick film has gathered.&nbsp;
But stay! there <i>is</i> something remarkable about that horse,
there is something in his action in which he differs from all the
rest: as he advances, the clamour is hushed! <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>all eyes
are turned upon him&mdash;what looks of interest&mdash;of
respect&mdash;and, what is this? people are taking off their
hats&mdash;surely not to that steed!&nbsp; Yes, verily! men,
especially old men, are taking off their hats to that one-eyed
steed, and I hear more than one deep-drawn ah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What horse is that?&rdquo; said I to a very old fellow,
the counterpart of the old man on the pony, save that the last
wore a faded suit of velveteen, and this one was dressed in a
white frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in mother England,&rdquo; said the very old
man, taking a knobbed stick from his mouth, and looking me in the
face, at first carelessly, but presently with something like
interest; &ldquo;he is old like myself, but can still trot his
twenty miles an hour.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t live long, my swain;
tall and overgrown ones like thee never does; yet, if you should
chance to reach my years, you may boast to thy great grand boys,
thou hast seen Marshland Shales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amain I did for the horse what I would neither do for earl or
baron, doffed my hat; yes! I doffed my hat to the wondrous horse,
the fast trotter, the best in mother England; and I too drew a
deep ah! and repeated the words of the old fellows around.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such a horse as this we shall never see again; a pity that
he is so old.&rdquo; <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a></p>
<p>Now during all this time I had a kind of consciousness that I
had been the object of some person&rsquo;s observation; that eyes
were fastened upon me from somewhere in the crowd.&nbsp;
Sometimes I thought myself watched from before, sometimes from
behind; and occasionally methought that, if I just turned my head
to the right or left, I should <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>meet a
peering and inquiring glance; and indeed once or twice I did
turn, expecting to see somebody whom I knew, yet always without
success; though it appeared to me that I was but a moment too
late, and that some one had just slipped away from the direction
to which I turned, like the figure in a magic lanthorn.&nbsp;
Once I was quite sure that there were a pair of eyes glaring over
my right shoulder; my attention, however, was so fully occupied
with the objects which I have attempted to describe, that I
thought very little of this coming and going, this flitting and
dodging of I knew not whom or what.&nbsp; It was, after all, a
matter of sheer indifference to me who was looking at me.&nbsp; I
could only wish, whomsoever it might be, to be more profitably
employed; so I continued enjoying what I saw; and now there was a
change in the scene, the wondrous old horse departed with his
aged guardian; other objects of interest are at hand; two or
three men on horseback are hurrying through the crowd, they are
widely different in their appearance from the other people of the
fair; not so much in dress, for they are clad something after the
fashion of rustic jockeys, but in their look&mdash;no light brown
hair have they, no ruddy cheeks, no blue quiet glances belong to
them; their features are dark, their locks long, black, and
shining, and their eyes are wild; they are admirable horsemen,
but they do not sit the saddle in the manner of common jockeys,
they seem to float or hover upon it, like gulls upon the waves;
two of them are mere striplings, but the third is a very tall man
with a countenance heroically beautiful, but wild, wild,
wild.&nbsp; As they rush along, the crowd give way on all sides,
and now a kind of ring or circus is <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>formed,
within which the strange men exhibit their horsemanship, rushing
past each other, in and out, after the manner of a reel, the tall
man occasionally balancing himself upon the saddle, and standing
erect on one foot.&nbsp; He had just regained his seat after the
latter feat, and was about to push his horse to a gallop, when a
figure started forward close from beside me, and laying his hand
on his neck, and pulling him gently downward, appeared to whisper
something into his ear; presently the tall man raised his head,
and, scanning the crowd for a moment in the direction in which I
was standing, fixed his eyes full upon me, and anon the
countenance of the whisperer was turned, but only in part, and
the side-glance of another pair of wild eyes was directed towards
my face, but the entire visage of the big black man, half
stooping as he was, was turned full upon mine.</p>
<p>But now, with a nod to the figure who had stopped him, and
with another inquiring glance at myself, the big man once more
put his steed into motion, and, after riding round the ring a few
more times, darted through a lane in the crowd, and followed by
his two companions disappeared, whereupon the figure who had
whispered to him, and had subsequently remained in the middle of
the space, came towards me, and, cracking a whip which he held in
his hand so loudly that the report was nearly equal to that of a
pocket pistol, he cried in a strange tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! the sap-engro? <a name="citation156"></a><a
href="#footnote156" class="citation">[156]</a>&nbsp; Lor! the
sap-engro upon the hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that word,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I
almost think I remember you.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&ldquo;Jasper, your pal!&nbsp; Truth, and no lie,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange that you should have known me,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am certain, but for the word you used, I
should never have recognised you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so strange as you may think, brother; there is
something in your face which would prevent people from forgetting
you, even though they might wish it; and your face is not much
altered since the time you wot of, though you are so much
grown.&nbsp; I thought it was you, but to make sure I dodged
about, inspecting you.&nbsp; I believe you felt me, though I
never touched you; a sign, brother, that we are akin, that we are
dui palor&mdash;two relations.&nbsp; Your blood beat when mine
was near, as mine always does at the coming of a brother; and we
became brothers in that lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are you staying?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;in
this town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the town; the like of us don&rsquo;t find it
exactly wholesome to stay in towns, we keep abroad.&nbsp; But I
have little to do here&mdash;come with me, and I&rsquo;ll show
you where we stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We descended the hill in the direction of the north, and
passing along the suburb reached the old Norman bridge, which we
crossed; the chalk precipice, with the ruin on its top, was now
before us; but turning to the left we walked swiftly along, and
presently came to some rising ground, which ascending, we found
ourselves upon a wild moor or heath. <a name="citation157"></a><a
href="#footnote157" class="citation">[157]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are one of them,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whom people
call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Jasper; &ldquo;but never mind what
people call us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;And that tall handsome man on the hill, whom you
whispered?&nbsp; I suppose he&rsquo;s one of ye.&nbsp; What is
his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawno Chikno,&rdquo; <a name="citation158"></a><a
href="#footnote158" class="citation">[158]</a> said Jasper,
&ldquo;which means the small one; we call him such because he is
the biggest man of all our nation.&nbsp; You say he is handsome,
that is not the word, brother; he&rsquo;s the beauty of the
world.&nbsp; Women run wild at the sight of Tawno.&nbsp; An
earl&rsquo;s daughter, near London&mdash;a fine young lady with
diamonds round her neck&mdash;fell in love with Tawno.&nbsp; I
have seen that lass on a heath, as this may be, kneel down to
Tawno, clasp his feet, begging to be his wife&mdash;or anything
else&mdash;if she might go with him.&nbsp; But Tawno would have
nothing to do with her: &lsquo;I have a wife of my own,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;a lawful Rommany wife, whom I love better than
the whole world, jealous though she sometimes
be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is she very beautiful?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know, brother, beauty is frequently a matter
of taste; however, as you ask my opinion, I should say not quite
so beautiful as himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had now arrived at a small valley between two hills, or
downs, the sides of which were covered with furze; in the midst
of this valley were various carts and low tents forming a rude
kind of encampment; several dark children were playing about, who
took no manner of notice of us.&nbsp; As we passed one of the
tents, however, a canvas screen was lifted up, and a woman
supported upon a crutch hobbled out.&nbsp; She was about the
middle age, and, besides being lame, was bitterly ugly; she was
very slovenly dressed, and on her swarthy features ill nature was
most visibly stamped.&nbsp; She <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>did not
deign me a look, but, addressing Jasper in a tongue which I did
not understand, appeared to put some eager questions to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; said Jasper, and passed
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; said he to me, &ldquo;he has
scarcely been gone an hour, and she&rsquo;s jealous
already.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what do you
think of her? you have seen her now, and can judge for
yourself&mdash;that &rsquo;ere woman is Tawno Chikno&rsquo;s
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went to the farthest of the tents, which stood at a slight
distance from the rest, and which exactly resembled the one which
I have described on a former occasion.&nbsp; We went in and sat
down one on each side of a small fire, which was smouldering on
the ground; there was no one else in the tent but a tall tawny
woman of middle age, who was busily knitting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Jasper, &ldquo;I wish to hold some
pleasant discourse with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as you please,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;provided
you can find anything pleasant to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said Jasper; &ldquo;and first of all
we will talk of yourself.&nbsp; Where have you been all this long
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here and there,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and far and near,
going about with the soldiers; but there is no soldiering now, so
we have sat down, father and family, in the town
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you still hunt snakes?&rdquo; said Jasper.</p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have given up that
long ago; I do better now: read books and learn
languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sorry you have given up your snake-hunting;
many&rsquo;s the strange talk I have had with our people about
your snake and yourself, and how you frightened my father and
mother in the lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are your father and mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where I shall never see them, brother; at least, I hope
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not dead; they are bitchadey pawdel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent across&mdash;banished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I understand; I am sorry for them.&nbsp; And
so you are here alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite alone, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not alone; but with the rest&mdash;Tawno Chikno
takes care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Takes care of me, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, stands to you in the place of a father&mdash;keeps
you out of harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you take me for, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about three years older than myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but you are of the Gorgios, and I am a Rommany

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that I want sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, being so old, you can&rsquo;t yet guide

<p>&ldquo;I can read Dante, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anan, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can charm snakes, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you can, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and horses too; bring me the most vicious in the

<p>&ldquo;Sells me horses, when I bid him.&nbsp; Those horses on
the chong <a name="citation162c"></a><a href="#footnote162c"

<p>&ldquo;And has he none of his own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes he has; but he is not so well off as
myself.&nbsp; When my father and mother were bitchadey pawdel,

family, which was not a small one.&nbsp; I was not older than you
when that happened; yet our people said they had never a better
krallis to contrive and plan for them, and to keep them in
order.&nbsp; And this is so well known, that many Rommany Chals,

themselves to us, living with us for a time, in order to better
themselves, more especially those of the poorer sort, who have
little of their own.&nbsp; Tawno is one of these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that fine fellow poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the poorest, brother.&nbsp; Handsome as he is,
he has not a horse of his own to ride on.&nbsp; Perhaps we may
put it down to his wife, who cannot move about, being a cripple,
as you saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; cried the woman, who had hitherto sat
knitting, at the farther end of the tent, without saying a word,
though not inattentive to our conversation, as I could perceive,
by certain glances, which she occasionally cast upon us
both.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; she screamed, fixing upon me
two eyes, which shone like burning coals, and which were filled
with an expression both of scorn and malignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is wonderful, is it, that we should have a language of our
own?&nbsp; What, you grudge the poor people the speech they talk
among themselves?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just like you Gorgios, you
would have everybody stupid, single-tongued idiots, like
yourselves.&nbsp; We are taken before the Poknees of the gav, <a
name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b"
class="citation">[164b]</a> myself and sister, to give an account
of ourselves.&nbsp; So I says to my sister&rsquo;s little boy,
speaking Rommany, I says to the little boy who is with us, run to
my son Jasper, and the rest, and tell them to be off, there are
hawks abroad.&nbsp; So the Poknees questions us, and lets us go,
not being able to make anything of us; but, as we are going, he
calls us back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good woman,&rsquo; says the Poknees,
&lsquo;what was that I heard you say just now to the little
boy?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I was telling him, your worship, to go
and see the time of day, and, to save trouble, I said it in our
language.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where did you get that
language?&rsquo; says the Poknees.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis our
own language, sir,&rsquo; I tells him, &lsquo;we did not steal
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I tell you what it is, my good
woman?&rsquo; says the Poknees.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would thank you,
sir,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;for &rsquo;tis often we are asked
about it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; says the <!--
page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Poknees, &lsquo;it is no language at all, merely a
made-up gibberish.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, bless your
wisdom,&rsquo; says I, with a curtsey, &lsquo;you can tell us
what our language is, without understanding it!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Another time we meet a parson.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good woman,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that you are talking?&nbsp; Is it
broken language?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course, your
reverence,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;we are broken people; give a
shilling, your reverence, to the poor broken woman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Oh, these Gorgios! they grudge us our very language!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She called you her son, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am her son, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said your parents were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitchadey pawdel; you thought right, brother.&nbsp;
This is my wife&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are married, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, truly; I am husband and father.&nbsp; You will see
wife and chabo <a name="citation165a"></a><a href="#footnote165a"

<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the gav, penning dukkerin.&rdquo; <a
name="citation165b"></a><a href="#footnote165b"
class="citation">[165b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking of language, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours must be a rum one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis called Rommany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would gladly know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need it sorely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you teach it me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we begin now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we do, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not whilst I am here,&rdquo; said the woman, flinging
her knitting down, and starting upon her feet; &ldquo;not whilst
I am here shall this Gorgio learn Rommany.&nbsp; A pretty
man&oelig;uvre, truly; and <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>what would
be the end of it?&nbsp; I goes to the farming ker <a
name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a"
class="citation">[166a]</a> with my sister, to tell a fortune,
and earn a few sixpences for the chabes.&nbsp; I sees a jolly pig
in the yard, and I says to my sister, speaking Rommany, &lsquo;Do
so and so,&rsquo; says I; which the farming man hearing, asks
what we are talking about.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing at all,
master,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;something about the weather;&rsquo;
when who should start up from behind a pale, where he has been
listening, but this ugly Gorgio, crying out, &lsquo;They are
after poisoning your pigs, neighbour!&rsquo; so that we are glad
to run, I and my sister, with perhaps the farm-engro shouting
after us.&nbsp; Says my sister to me, when we have got fairly
off, &lsquo;How came that ugly one to know what you said to
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon I answers, &lsquo;It all comes of my
son Jasper, who brings the Gorgio to our fire, and must needs be
teaching him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who was fool there?&rsquo; says
my sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who, indeed, but my son Jasper,&rsquo; I
answers.&nbsp; And here should I be a greater fool to sit still
and suffer it; which I will not do.&nbsp; I do not like the look
of him; he looks over-gorgious.&nbsp; An ill day to the Romans
when he masters Rommany; and, when I says that, I pens a true
dukkerin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call God, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better be jawing,&rdquo; <a
name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b"
class="citation">[166b]</a> said the woman, raising her voice to
a terrible scream; &ldquo;you had better be moving off, my
Gorgio; hang you for a keen one, sitting there by the fire, and
stealing my language before my face.&nbsp; Do you know whom you
have to deal with?&nbsp; Do you know that I am dangerous?&nbsp;
My name is Herne, and I comes of the hairy ones!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>And a hairy one she looked!&nbsp; She wore her hair
clubbed upon her head, fastened with many strings and ligatures;
but now, tearing these off, her locks, originally jet black, but
now partially grizzled with age, fell down on every side of her,
covering her face and back as far down as her knees.&nbsp; No
she-bear of Lapland ever looked more fierce and hairy than did
that woman, as standing in the open part of the tent, with her
head bent down, and her shoulders drawn up, seemingly about to
precipitate herself upon me, she repeated, again and
again,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Herne, and I comes of the hairy
ones!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call God Duvel, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds very like Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doth, brother, it doth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you call divine, I mean godly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I call that duvelskoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of something, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be a rum thing if divine and devilish were
originally one and the same word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would, brother, it would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>From this time I had frequent interviews with Jasper,
sometimes in his tent, sometimes on the heath, about which we
would roam for hours, discoursing on various matters.&nbsp;
Sometimes mounted on one of his horses, of which he had several,
I would accompany him to various fairs and markets in the
neighbourhood, to which he went on his own affairs, or those of
his tribe.&nbsp; I soon found that I had become acquainted with a
most <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>singular people, whose habits and
pursuits awakened within me the highest interest.&nbsp; Of all
connected with them, however, their language was doubtless that
which exercised the greatest influence over my imagination.&nbsp;
I had at first some suspicion that it would prove a mere made-up
gibberish; but I was soon undeceived.&nbsp; Broken, corrupted,
and half in ruins as it was, it was not long before I found that
it was an original speech, far more so, indeed, than one or two
others of high name and celebrity, which, up to that time, I had
been in the habit of regarding with respect and veneration.&nbsp;
Indeed many obscure points connected with the vocabulary of these
languages, and to which neither classic nor modern lore afforded
any clue, I thought I could now clear up by means of this strange
broken tongue, spoken by people who dwelt amongst thickets and
furze bushes, in tents as tawny as their faces, and whom the
generality of mankind designated, and with much semblance of
justice, as thieves and vagabonds.&nbsp; But where did this
speech come from, and who were they who spoke it?&nbsp; These
were questions which I could not solve, and which Jasper himself,
when pressed, confessed his inability to answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, whoever we be, brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are
an old people, and not what folks in general imagine, broken
Gorgios; and, if we are not Egyptians, we are at any rate Rommany
Chals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rommany Chals!&nbsp; I should not wonder after
all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that these people had something to do
with the founding of Rome.&nbsp; Rome, it is said, was built by
vagabonds; who knows but that some tribe of the kind settled down
thereabouts, and called the town which they built after their
name? <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>but whence did they come originally?
ah! there is the difficulty.&rdquo; <a name="citation169a"></a><a
href="#footnote169a" class="citation">[169a]</a></p>
<p>But abandoning these questions, which at that time were far
too profound for me, I went on studying the language, and at the
same time the characters and manners of these strange
people.&nbsp; My rapid progress in the former astonished, while
it delighted, Jasper.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll no longer call you
Sap-engro, brother,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but rather Lav-engro,
which in the language of the Gorgios meaneth Word
Master.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, brother,&rdquo; said Tawno
Chikno, with whom I had become very intimate, &ldquo;you had
better call him Cooro-mengro. <a name="citation169b"></a><a
href="#footnote169b" class="citation">[169b]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>I
have put on <i>the gloves</i> with him, and find him a pure fist
master; I like him for that, for I am a Cooro-mengro myself, and
was born at Brummagem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I likes him for his modesty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno;
&ldquo;I never hears any ill words come from his mouth, but, on
the contrary, much sweet language.&nbsp; His talk is golden, and
he has taught my eldest to say his prayers in Rommany, which my
rover had never the grace to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the
pal of my rom,&rdquo; <a name="citation170a"></a><a
href="#footnote170a" class="citation">[170a]</a> said Mrs.
Petulengro, who was a very handsome woman, &ldquo;and therefore I
likes him, and not the less for his being a rye; <a
name="citation170b"></a><a href="#footnote170b"
class="citation">[170b]</a> folks calls me high-minded, and
perhaps I have reason to be so; before I married Pharaoh I had an
offer from a lord.&nbsp; I likes the young rye, and, if he
chooses to follow us, he shall have my sister.&nbsp; What say
you, mother? should not the young rye have my sister
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to my people,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herne,
placing a bundle upon a donkey, which was her own peculiar
property; &ldquo;I am going to Yorkshire, for I can stand this no
longer.&nbsp; You say you like him: in that we differs; I hates
the Gorgio, and would like, speaking Romanly, to mix a little
poison with his waters.&nbsp; And now go to Lundra, <a
name="citation170c"></a><a href="#footnote170c"
class="citation">[170c]</a> my children; I goes to
Yorkshire.&nbsp; Take my blessing with ye, and a little bit of a
gillie <a name="citation170d"></a><a href="#footnote170d"
class="citation">[170d]</a> to cheer your hearts with when ye are
weary.&nbsp; In all kinds of weather have we lived together; but
now we are parted.&nbsp; I goes broken-hearted&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t keep you company; ye are no longer Rommany.&nbsp; To
gain a bad brother, ye have lost a good mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Profession?&mdash;Not Fitted for a
Churchman&mdash;Erratic Course&mdash;The Bitter
Draught&mdash;Principle of Woe&mdash;Thou Wouldst be
Joyous&mdash;What Ails You?&mdash;Poor Child of Clay.</p>
<p>So the Gypsies departed; Mrs. Herne to Yorkshire, and the rest
to London: as for myself, I continued in the house of my parents,
passing my time in much the same manner as I have already
described, principally in philological pursuits; but I was now
sixteen, and it was highly necessary that I should adopt some
profession, unless I intended to fritter away my existence, and
to be a useless burden to those who had given me birth; but what
profession was I to choose? there being none in the wide world
perhaps for which I was suited; nor was there any one for which I
felt any decided inclination, though perhaps there existed within
me a lurking penchant for the profession of arms, which was
natural enough, as, from my earliest infancy, I had been
accustomed to military sights and sounds; but this profession was
then closed, as I have already hinted, and, as I believe, it has
since continued, to those who, like myself, had no better claims
to urge than the services of a father.</p>
<p><!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>My father, who, for certain reasons of his own, had no
very high opinion of the advantages resulting from this career,
would have gladly seen me enter the Church.&nbsp; His desire was,
however, considerably abated by one or two passages of my life,
which occurred to his recollection.&nbsp; He particularly dwelt
on the unheard-of manner in which I had picked up the Irish
language, and drew from thence the conclusion that I was not
fitted by nature to cut a respectable figure at an English
university.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will fly off in a tangent,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and, when called upon to exhibit his skill in
Greek, will be found proficient in Irish; I have observed the
poor lad attentively, and really do not know what to make of him;
but I am afraid he will never make a churchman!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
I have no doubt that my excellent father was right, both in his
premises and the conclusion at which he arrived.&nbsp; I had
undoubtedly, at one period of my life, forsaken Greek for Irish,
and the instructions of a learned Protestant divine, for those of
a Papist gossoon, the card-fancying Murtagh; and of late, though
I kept it a strict secret, I had abandoned in a great measure the
study of the beautiful Italian, and the recitation of the
sonorous terzets of the Divine Comedy, in which at one time I
took the greatest delight, in order to become acquainted with the
broken speech, and yet more broken songs, of certain houseless
wanderers whom I had met at a horse fair.&nbsp; Such an erratic
course was certainly by no means in consonance with the sober and
unvarying routine of college study.&nbsp; And my father, who was
a man of excellent common sense, displayed it, in not pressing me
to adopt a profession which required <!-- page 173--><a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>qualities
of mind which he saw I did not possess.</p>
<p>Other professions were talked of, amongst which the law; but
now an event occurred which had nearly stopped my career, and
merged all minor points of solicitude in anxiety for my
life.&nbsp; My strength and appetite suddenly deserted me, and I
began to pine and droop.&nbsp; Some said that I had overgrown
myself, and that these were the symptoms of a rapid decline; I
grew worse and worse, and was soon stretched upon my bed, from
which it seemed scarcely probable that I should ever more rise,
the physicians themselves giving but slight hopes of my recovery:
as for myself, I made up my mind to die, and felt quite
resigned.&nbsp; I was sadly ignorant at that time, and, when I
thought of death, it appeared to me little else than a pleasant
sleep, and I wished for sleep, of which I got but little.&nbsp;
It was well that I did not die that time, for I repeat that I was
sadly ignorant of many important things.&nbsp; I did not die, for
somebody coming gave me a strange, bitter draught; a decoction, I
believe, of a bitter root which grows on commons and desolate
places: and the person who gave it me was an ancient female, a
kind of doctress, who had been my nurse in my infancy, and who,
hearing of my state, had come to see me; so I drank the draught,
and became a little better, and I continued taking draughts made
from the bitter root till I manifested symptoms of
convalescence.</p>
<p>But how much more quickly does strength desert the human frame
than return to it!&nbsp; I had become convalescent, it is true,
but my state of feebleness was truly pitiable.&nbsp; I believe it
is in that state that <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>the most remarkable feature of human
physiology frequently exhibits itself.&nbsp; Oh, how dare I
mention the dark feeling of mysterious dread which comes over the
mind, and which the lamp of reason, though burning bright the
while, is unable to dispel!&nbsp; Art thou, as leeches say, the
concomitant of disease&mdash;the result of shattered
nerves?&nbsp; Nay, rather the principle of woe itself, the
fountain-head of all sorrow co-existent with man, whose influence
he feels when yet unborn, and whose workings he testifies with
his earliest cries, when, &ldquo;drowned in tears,&rdquo; he
first beholds the light; for, as the sparks fly upward, so is man
born to trouble, and woe doth he bring with him into the world,
even thyself, dark one, terrible one, causeless, unbegotten,
without a father.&nbsp; Oh, how unfrequently dost thou break down
the barriers which divide thee from the poor soul of man, and
overcast its sunshine with thy gloomy shadow.&nbsp; In the
brightest days of prosperity&mdash;in the midst of health and
wealth&mdash;how sentient is the poor human creature of thy
neighbourhood! how instinctively aware that the flood-gates of
horror may be cast open, and the dark stream engulf him for ever
and ever!&nbsp; Then is it not lawful for man to exclaim,
&ldquo;Better that I had never been born!&rdquo;&nbsp; Fool, for
thyself thou wast not born, but to fulfil the inscrutable decrees
of thy Creator; and how dost thou know that this dark principle
is not, after all, thy best friend; that it is not that which
tempers the whole mass of thy corruption?&nbsp; It may be, for
what thou knowest, the mother of wisdom, and of great works: it
is the dread of the horror of the night that makes the pilgrim
hasten on his way.&nbsp; When thou feelest it nigh, let thy
safety word be <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>&ldquo;Onward&rdquo;; if thou tarry,
thou art overwhelmed.&nbsp; Courage! build great
works&mdash;&rsquo;tis urging thee&mdash;it is ever nearest the
favourites of God&mdash;the fool knows little of it.&nbsp; Thou
wouldst be joyous, wouldst thou? then be a fool.&nbsp; What great
work was ever the result of joy, the puny one?&nbsp; Who have
been the wise ones, the mighty ones, the conquering ones of this
earth? the joyous?&nbsp; I believe not.&nbsp; The fool is happy,
or comparatively so&mdash;certainly the least sorrowful, but he
is still a fool: and whose notes are sweetest, those of the
nightingale, or of the silly lark?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, my child?&rdquo; said a mother to her
son, as he lay on a couch under the influence of the dreadful
one; &ldquo;what ails you? you seem afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; And so I am; a dreadful fear is upon me.</p>
<p><i>Mother</i>.&nbsp; But of what? there is no one can harm
you; of what are you apprehensive?</p>
<p><i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; Of nothing that I can express; I know not
what I am afraid of, but afraid I am.</p>
<p><i>Mother</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps you see sights and visions; I
knew a lady once who was continually thinking that she saw an
armed man threaten her, but it was only an imagination, a phantom
of the brain.</p>
<p><i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; No armed man threatens me; and &rsquo;tis
not a thing like that would cause me any fear.&nbsp; Did an armed
man threaten me, I would get up and fight him; weak as I am, I
would wish for nothing better, for then, perhaps, I should lose
this fear; mine is a dread of I know not what, and there the
horror lies.</p>
<p><i>Mother</i>.&nbsp; Your forehead is cool, and your speech
collected.&nbsp; Do you know where you are?</p>

a book which was written by a Florentine; all this I see, and
that there is no ground for being afraid.&nbsp; I am, moreover,
quite cool, and feel no pain&mdash;but, but . . .</p>

Gwilym&mdash;Glorious English Law&mdash;There They Pass&mdash;My
Dear Old Master&mdash;The Deal Desk&mdash;Language of the
Tents&mdash;Where is Morfydd?&mdash;Go to&mdash;Only Once.</p>
<p>It has been said by this or that writer, I scarcely know by
whom, that, in proportion as we grow old, and our time becomes
short, the swifter does it pass, until at last, as we approach
the borders of the grave, it assumes all the speed and
impetuosity of a river about to precipitate itself into an abyss;
this is doubtless the case, provided we can carry to the grave
those pleasant thoughts and delusions which alone render life
agreeable, and to which even to the very last we would gladly
cling; but what becomes of the swiftness of time, when the mind
sees the vanity of human pursuits? which is sure to be the case
when its fondest, dearest hopes have been blighted at the very
moment when the harvest was deemed secure.&nbsp; What becomes
from that moment, I repeat, of the shortness of time?&nbsp; I put
not the question to those who have never known that
trial,&mdash;they are satisfied with themselves and all around
them, with what they have done, and yet hope to do; some carry
their delusions with them to the borders of the grave, ay, to the
very moment when they fall into it; a beautiful <!-- page
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>golden cloud surrounds them to the last, and such talk
of the shortness of time: through the medium of that cloud the
world has ever been a pleasant world to them; their only regret
is that they are so soon to quit it; but oh, ye dear deluded
hearts, it is not every one who is so fortunate!</p>
<p>To the generality of mankind there is no period like
youth.&nbsp; The generality are far from fortunate; but the
period of youth, even to the least so, offers moments of
considerable happiness, for they are not only disposed, but able
to enjoy most things within their reach.&nbsp; With what trifles
at that period are we content; the things from which in
after-life we should turn away in disdain please us then, for we
are in the midst of a golden cloud, and everything seems decked
with a golden hue.&nbsp; Never during any portion of my life did
time flow on more speedily than during the two or three years
immediately succeeding the period to which we arrived in the
preceding chapter: since then it has flagged often enough;
sometimes it has seemed to stand entirely still; and the reader
may easily judge how it fares at the present, from the
circumstance of my taking pen in hand, and endeavouring to write
down the passages of my life&mdash;a last resource with most
people.&nbsp; But at the period to which I allude I was just, as
I may say, entering upon life; I had adopted a profession,
and&mdash;to keep up my character, simultaneously with that
profession&mdash;the study of a new language&mdash;I speedily
became a proficient in the one, but ever remained a novice in the
other: a novice in the law, but a perfect master in the Welsh
tongue. <a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>Yes! very pleasant times were those, when within the
womb of a lofty deal desk, behind which I sat for some eight
hours every day, transcribing (when I imagined eyes were upon me)
documents of every description in every possible hand, Blackstone
kept company with Ab Gwilym&mdash;the polished English lawyer of
the last century, who wrote long and prosy chapters on the rights
of things&mdash;with a certain wild Welshman, who some four
hundred years before that time indited immortal cowydds and odes
to the wives of Cambrian chieftains&mdash;more particularly to
one Morfydd, the wife of a certain hunchbacked dignitary called
by the poet facetiously Bwa Bach&mdash;generally terminating with
the modest request of a little private parlance beneath the green
wood bough, with no other witness than the eos, or nightingale, a
request which, if the poet himself may be believed, rather a
doubtful point, was seldom, very seldom, denied.&nbsp; And by
what strange chance had Ab Gwilym and Blackstone, two personages
so exceedingly different, been thus brought together?&nbsp; From
what the reader already knows of me, he may be quite prepared to
find me reading the former; but what could have induced me to
take up Blackstone, or rather the law?</p>
<p>I have ever loved to be as explicit as possible; on which
account, perhaps, I never attained to any proficiency in the law,
the essence of which is said to be ambiguity; most questions may
be answered in a few words, and this among the rest, though
connected with the law.&nbsp; My parents deemed it necessary that
I should adopt some profession, they named the law; the law was
as agreeable to me as any other profession within my reach, so I
<!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>adopted the law, and the consequence was, that
Blackstone, probably for the first time, found himself in company
with Ab Gwilym.&nbsp; By adopting the law I had not ceased to be
Lavengro. <a name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a></p>
<p>So I sat behind a desk many hours in the day, ostensibly
engaged in transcribing documents of various kinds; the scene of
my labours was a strange old house, occupying one side of a long
and narrow court, into which, however, the greater number of the
windows looked not, but into an extensive garden, filled with
fruit trees, in the rear of a large, handsome house, belonging to
a highly respectable gentleman, who, <i>moyennant un douceur
consid&eacute;rable</i>, had consented to instruct my
father&rsquo;s youngest son in the mysteries of glorious English
law.&nbsp; Ah! would that I could describe the good gentleman in
the manner which he deserves; he has long since sunk to his place
in a respectable vault, in the aisle of a very respectable
church, whilst an exceedingly respectable marble slab against the
neighbouring wall tells on a Sunday some eye wandering from its
prayer-book that his dust lies below; to secure such
respectabilities in death, he passed a most respectable
life.&nbsp; Let no one sneer, he accomplished much; his life was
peaceful, so was his death.&nbsp; Are these trifles?&nbsp; I wish
I could describe him, for I loved the man, and with reason, for
he was ever kind to me, to whom kindness has not always been
shown; and he was, moreover, a choice specimen of a class which
no longer exists&mdash;a gentleman lawyer of the old
school.&nbsp; I would fain describe him, but figures with which
he has nought to do press <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>forward and
keep him from my mind&rsquo;s eye; there they pass, Spaniard and
Moor, Gypsy, Turk, and livid Jew.&nbsp; But who is that? what
that thick pursy man in the loose, snuff-coloured great-coat,
with the white stockings, drab breeches, and silver buckles on
his shoes; that man with the bull neck, and singular head,
immense in the lower part, especially about the jaws, but
tapering upward like a pear; the man with the bushy brows, small
grey eyes, replete with cat-like expression, whose grizzled hair
is cut close, and whose ear lobes are pierced with small golden
rings?&nbsp; Oh! that is not my dear old master, but a widely
different personage.&nbsp; <i>Bon jour</i>, <i>Monsieur
Vidocq</i>! <i>expressions de ma part &agrave; Monsieur Le Baron
Taylor</i>.&nbsp; But here he comes at last, my veritable old
master!</p>
<p>A more respectable-looking individual was never seen; he
really looked what he was, a gentleman of the law&mdash;there was
nothing of the pettifogger about him: somewhat under the middle
size, and somewhat rotund in person, he was always dressed in a
full suit of black, never worn long enough to become
threadbare.&nbsp; His face was rubicund, and not without
keenness; but the most remarkable thing about him was the crown
of his head, which was bald, and shone like polished ivory,
nothing more white, smooth, and lustrous.&nbsp; Some people have
said that he wore false calves, probably because his black silk
stockings never exhibited a wrinkle; they might just as well have
said that he waddled, because his shoes creaked; for these last,
which were always without a speck, and polished as his crown,
though of a different hue, did creak, as he walked rather
slowly.&nbsp; I cannot say that I ever saw him walk fast.</p>
<p><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>He had a handsome practice, and might have died a very
rich man, much richer than he did, had he not been in the habit
of giving rather expensive dinners to certain great people, who
gave him nothing in return, except their company; I could never
discover his reasons for doing so, as he always appeared to me a
remarkably quiet man, by nature averse to noise and bustle; but
in all dispositions there are anomalies: I have already said that
he lived in a handsome house, and I may as well here add that he
had a very handsome wife, who both dressed and talked exceedingly
well.</p>
<p>So I sat behind the deal desk, engaged in copying documents of
various kinds; and in the apartment in which I sat, and in the
adjoining ones, there were others, some of whom likewise copied
documents, while some were engaged in the yet more difficult task
of drawing them up; and some of these, sons of nobody, were paid
for the work they did, whilst others, like myself, sons of
somebody, paid for being permitted to work, which, as our
principal observed, was but reasonable, forasmuch as we not
unfrequently utterly spoiled the greater part of the work
entrusted to our hands.</p>
<p>There was one part of the day when I generally found myself
quite alone, I mean at the hour when the rest went home to their
principal meal; I, being the youngest, was left to take care of
the premises, to answer the bell, and so forth, till relieved,
which was seldom before the expiration of an hour and a half,
when I myself went home; this period, however, was anything but
disagreeable to me, for it was then that I did what best pleased
me, and, leaving off copying the documents, I sometimes indulged
in a fit of musing, my chin <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>resting on
both my hands, and my elbows planted on the desk; or, opening the
desk aforesaid, I would take out one of the books contained
within it, and the book which I took out was almost invariably,
not Blackstone, but Ab Gwilym.</p>
<p>Ah, that Ab Gwilym!&nbsp; I am much indebted to him, and it
were ungrateful on my part not to devote a few lines to him and
his songs in this my history.&nbsp; Start not, reader, I am not
going to trouble you with a poetical dissertation; no, no!&nbsp;
I know my duty too well to introduce anything of the kind; but I,
who imagine I know several things, and amongst others the
workings of your mind at this moment, have an idea that you are
anxious to learn a little, a very little, more about Ab Gwilym
than I have hitherto told you, the two or three words that I have
dropped having awakened within you a languid kind of
curiosity.&nbsp; I have no hesitation in saying that he makes one
of the some half-dozen really great poets whose verses, in
whatever language they wrote, exist at the present day, and are
more or less known.&nbsp; It matters little how I first became
acquainted with the writings of this man, and how the short thick
volume, stuffed full with his immortal imaginings, first came
into my hands.&nbsp; I was studying Welsh, and I fell in with Ab
Gwilym by no very strange chance.&nbsp; But, before I say more
about Ab Gwilym, I must be permitted&mdash;I really must&mdash;to
say a word or two about the language in which he wrote, that same
&ldquo;Sweet Welsh.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I remember right, I found the
language a difficult one; in mastering it, however, I derived
unexpected assistance from what of Irish remained in my head, and
I soon found that they were cognate dialects, springing from <!--
page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>some old tongue which itself, perhaps, had sprung from
one much older.&nbsp; And here I cannot help observing cursorily
that I every now and then, whilst studying this Welsh, generally
supposed to be the original tongue of Britain, encountered words
which, according to the lexicographers, were venerable words
highly expressive, showing the wonderful power and originality of
the Welsh, in which, however, they were no longer used in common
discourse, but were relics, precious relics, of the first speech
of Britain, perhaps of the world; with which words, however, I
was already well acquainted, and which I had picked up, not in
learned books, classic books, and in tongues of old renown, but
whilst listening to Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno talking over
their every-day affairs in the language of the tents; which
circumstance did not fail to give rise to deep reflection in
those moments when, planting my elbows on the deal desk, I rested
my chin upon my hands.&nbsp; But it is probable that I should
have abandoned the pursuit of the Welsh language, after obtaining
a very superficial acquaintance with it, had it not been for Ab
Gwilym.</p>
<p>A strange songster was that who, pretending to be captivated
by every woman he saw, was, in reality, in love with nature
alone&mdash;wild, beautiful, solitary nature&mdash;her mountains
and cascades, her forests and streams, her birds, fishes, and
wild animals.&nbsp; Go to, Ab Gwilym, with thy pseudo-amatory
odes, to Morfydd, or this or that other lady, fair or
ugly&mdash;little didst thou care for any of them; Dame Nature
was thy love, however thou mayest seek to disguise the
truth.&nbsp; Yes, yes, send thy love-message to Morfydd, the fair
wanton.&nbsp; By <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>whom dost thou send it, I would
know? by the salmon forsooth, which haunts the rushing stream!
the glorious salmon which bounds and gambols in the flashing
water, and whose ways and circumstances thou so well
describest&mdash;see, there he hurries upwards through the
flashing water.&nbsp; Halloo! what a glimpse of glory&mdash;but
where is Morfydd the while?&nbsp; What, another message to the
wife of Bwa Bach?&nbsp; Ay, truly; and by whom?&mdash;the wind!
the swift wind, the rider of the world, whose course is not to be
stayed; who gallops o&rsquo;er the mountain, and, when he comes
to broadest river, asks neither for boat nor ferry; who has
described the wind so well&mdash;his speed and power?&nbsp; But
where is Morfydd?&nbsp; And now thou art awaiting Morfydd, the
wanton, the wife of the Bwa Bach; thou art awaiting her beneath
the tall trees, amidst the underwood; but she comes not; no
Morfydd is there.&nbsp; Quite right, Ab Gwilym; what wantest thou
with Morfydd?&nbsp; But another form is nigh at hand, that of red
Reynard, who, seated upon his chine at the mouth of his cave,
looks very composedly at thee; thou startest, bendest thy bow,
thy cross-bow, intending to hit Reynard with the bolt just about
the jaw; but the bow breaks, Reynard barks and disappears into
his cave, which by thine own account reaches hell&mdash;and then
thou ravest at the misfortune of thy bow, and the non-appearance
of Morfydd, and abusest Reynard.&nbsp; Go to, thou carest neither
for thy bow nor for Morfydd, thou merely seekest an opportunity
to speak of Reynard; and who has described him like thee? the
brute with the sharp shrill cry, the black reverse of melody,
whose face sometimes wears a smile like the devil&rsquo;s in the
<!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Evangile.&nbsp; But now thou art actually with Morfydd;
yes, she has stolen from the dwelling of the Bwa Bach and has met
thee beneath those rocks&mdash;she is actually with thee, Ab
Gwilym; but she is not long with thee, for a storm comes on, and
thunder shatters the rocks&mdash;Morfydd flees!&nbsp; Quite
right, Ab Gwilym; thou hadst no need of her, a better theme for
song is the voice of the Lord&mdash;the rock shatterer&mdash;than
the frail wife of the Bwa Bach.&nbsp; Go to, Ab Gwilym, thou wast
a wiser and a better man than thou wouldst fain have had people
believe.</p>
<p>But enough of thee and thy songs!&nbsp; Those times passed
rapidly; with Ab Gwilym in my hand, I was in the midst of
enchanted ground, in which I experienced sensations akin to those
I had felt of yore whilst spelling my way through the wonderful
book&mdash;the delight of my childhood.&nbsp; I say akin, for
perhaps only once in our lives do we experience unmixed wonder
and delight; and these I had already known.</p>

<p>Silver Grey&mdash;Good Word for Everybody&mdash;A Remarkable
Youth&mdash;Clients&mdash;Grades in Society&mdash;The
Archdeacon&mdash;Reading the Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I have not acted very wisely in
putting this boy of ours to the law,&rdquo; said my father to my
mother, as they sat together one summer evening in their little
garden, beneath the shade of some tall poplars.</p>
<p>Yes, there sat my father in the garden chair which leaned
against the wall of his quiet home, the haven in which he had
sought rest, and, praise be to God, found it, after many a year
of poorly requited toil; there he sat, with locks of silver grey
which set off so nobly his fine bold but benevolent face, his
faithful consort at his side, and his trusty dog at his
feet&mdash;an eccentric animal of the genuine regimental breed,
who, born amongst red-coats, had not yet become reconciled to
those of any other hue, barking and tearing at them when they
drew near the door, but testifying his fond reminiscence of the
former by hospitable waggings of the tail whenever a uniform made
its appearance&mdash;at present a very unfrequent occurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have not done right in putting <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>him to the law,&rdquo; said my father, resting his chin
upon his gold-headed bamboo cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what makes you think so?&rdquo; said my
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been taking my usual evening walk up the road,
with the animal here,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;and, as I
walked along, I overtook the boy&rsquo;s master, Mr. S---.&nbsp;
We shook hands, and, after walking a little way farther, we
turned back together, talking about this and that; the state of
the country, the weather, and the dog, which he greatly admired;
for he is a good-natured man, and has a good word for everybody,
though the dog all but bit him when he attempted to coax his
head; after the dog, we began talking about the boy; it was
myself who introduced that subject: I thought it was a good
opportunity to learn how he was getting on, so I asked what he
thought of my son; he hesitated at first, seeming scarcely to
know what to say; at length he came out with &lsquo;Oh, a very
extraordinary youth, a most remarkable youth indeed,
captain!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am
glad to hear it, but I hope you find him steady?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Steady, steady,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;why, yes,
he&rsquo;s steady, I cannot say that he is not
steady.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said I, beginning
to be rather uneasy, &lsquo;I see plainly that you are not
altogether satisfied with him; I was afraid you would not be,
for, though he is my own son, I am anything but blind to his
imperfections: but do tell me what particular fault you have to
find with him; and I will do my best to make him alter his
conduct.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No fault to find with him, captain,
I assure you, no fault whatever; the youth is a remarkable youth,
an extraordinary youth, only . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; As I told you
before, Mr. S--- <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>is the best natured man in the
world, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that I could
get him to say a single word to the disadvantage of the boy, for
whom he seems to entertain a very great regard.&nbsp; At last I
forced the truth from him, and grieved I was to hear it; though I
must confess that I was somewhat prepared for it.&nbsp; It
appears that the lad has a total want of
discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said my
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can understand nothing that would seem for a moment
to impugn the conduct of that child.&nbsp; I am not, however, so
blind; want of discrimination was the word, and it both sounds
well, and is expressive.&nbsp; It appears that, since he has been
placed where he is, he has been guilty of the grossest blunders;
only the other day, Mr. S--- told me, as he was engaged in close
conversation with one of his principal clients, the boy came to
tell him that a person wanted particularly to speak with him;
and, on going out, he found a lamentable figure with one eye, who
came to ask for charity; whom, nevertheless, the lad had ushered
into a private room, and installed in an arm-chair, like a
justice of the peace, instead of telling him to go about his
business&mdash;now what did that show, but a total want of
discrimination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we may never have anything worse to reproach him
with,&rdquo; said my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what worse we could reproach him
with,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;I mean of course as far as
his profession is concerned; discrimination is the very
key-stone; if he treated all people alike, he would soon become a
beggar himself; there are grades in society as well as in the
army; and according to those grades we should fashion our <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>behaviour, else there would instantly be an end of all
order and discipline.&nbsp; I am afraid that the child is too
condescending to his inferiors, whilst to his superiors he is apt
to be unbending enough; I don&rsquo;t believe that would do in
the world; I am sure it would not in the army.&nbsp; He told me
another anecdote with respect to his behaviour, which shocked me
more than the other had done.&nbsp; It appears that his wife,
who, by the bye, is a very fine woman, and highly fashionable,
gave him permission to ask the boy to tea one evening, for she is
herself rather partial to the lad; there had been a great dinner
party there that day, and there were a great many fashionable
people, so the boy went and behaved very well and modestly for
some time, and was rather noticed, till, unluckily, a very great
gentleman, an archdeacon I think, put some questions to him, and,
finding that he understood the languages, began talking to him
about the classics.&nbsp; What do you think? the boy had the
impertinence to say that the classics were much overvalued, and
amongst other things that some horrid fellow or other, some
Welshman I think (thank God it was not an Irishman), was a better
poet than Ovid; the company were of course horrified; the
archdeacon, who is seventy years of age, and has seven thousand a
year, took snuff and turned away.&nbsp; Mrs. S--- turned up her
eyes; Mr. S---, however, told me with his usual good-nature (I
suppose to spare my feelings) that he rather enjoyed the thing,
and thought it a capital joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;that a boy of
his years should entertain an opinion of his own&mdash;I mean one
which militates against all established <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>authority&mdash;is astounding; as well might a raw
recruit pretend to offer an unfavourable opinion on the manual
and platoon exercise; the idea is preposterous; the lad is too
independent by half.&nbsp; I never yet knew one of an independent
spirit get on in the army,&mdash;the secret of success in the
army is the spirit of subordination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is a poor spirit after all,&rdquo; said my
mother; &ldquo;but the child is not in the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is well for him that he is not,&rdquo; said my
father; &ldquo;but you do not talk wisely; the world is a field
of battle, and he who leaves the ranks, what can he expect but to
be cut down?&nbsp; I call his present behaviour leaving the
ranks, and going vapouring about without orders; his only chance
lies in falling in again as quick as possible; does he think he
can carry the day by himself? an opinion of his own at these
years&mdash;I confess I am exceedingly uneasy about the
lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me uneasy too,&rdquo; said my mother;
&ldquo;but I really think you are too hard upon the child; he is
not a bad child, after all, though not, perhaps, all you could
wish him; he is always ready to read the Bible.&nbsp; Let us go
in; he is in the room above us; at least he was two hours ago, I
left him there bending over his books; I wonder what he has been
doing all this time, it is now getting late; let us go in, and he
shall read to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am getting old,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;and I
love to hear the Bible read to me, for my own sight is something
dim; yet I do not wish the child to read to me this night, I
cannot so soon forget what I have heard; but I hear my eldest
son&rsquo;s voice, he is now entering the gate; he shall read the
Bible to us this night.&nbsp; What say you?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span

<p>The Eldest Son&mdash;Saying of Wild Finland&mdash;The Critical

Father&rsquo;s Blessing&mdash;Miracle of Art&mdash;The
Pope&rsquo;s House&mdash;Young Enthusiast&mdash;Pictures of
England&mdash;Persist and Wrestle&mdash;The Little Dark Man.</p>
<p>The eldest son!&nbsp; The regard and affection which my father
entertained for his first-born were natural enough, and appeared
to none more so than myself, who cherished the same feelings
towards him.&nbsp; What he was as a boy the reader already knows,
for the reader has seen him as a boy; fain would I describe him
at the time of which I am now speaking, when he had attained the
verge of manhood, but the pen fails me, and I attempt not the
task; and yet it ought to be an easy one, for how frequently does
his form visit my mind&rsquo;s eye in slumber and in wakefulness,
in the light of day, and in the night watches; but last night I
saw him in his beauty and his strength; he was about to speak,
and my ear was on the stretch, when at once I awoke, and there
was I alone, and the night storm was howling amidst the branches
of the pines which surround my lonely dwelling: &ldquo;Listen to
the moaning of the pine, at whose root thy hut is
fastened,&rdquo;&mdash;a saying that, of wild <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Finland, in
which there is wisdom; I listened and thought of life and death.
. . . Of all human beings that I have ever known, that elder
brother was the most frank and generous, ay, and the quickest and
readiest, and the best adapted to do a great thing needful at the
critical time, when the delay of a moment would be fatal.&nbsp; I
have known him dash from a steep bank into a stream in his full
dress, and pull out a man who was drowning; yet there were twenty
others bathing in the water, who might have saved him by putting
out a hand, without inconvenience to themselves, which, however,
they did not do, but stared with stupid surprise at the drowning
one&rsquo;s struggles.&nbsp; Yes, whilst some shouted from the
bank to those in the water to save the drowning one, and those in
the water did nothing, my brother neither shouted nor stood
still, but dashed from the bank and did the one thing needful,
which, under such circumstances, not one man in a million would
have done.&nbsp; Now, who can wonder that a brave old man should
love a son like this, and prefer him to any other?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, my own boy, you are the very image of myself,
the day I took off my coat in the park to fight Big Ben,&rdquo;
said my father, on meeting his son wet and dripping, immediately
after his bold feat.&nbsp; And who cannot excuse the honest pride
of the old man&mdash;the stout old man?</p>
<p>Ay, old man, that son was worthy of thee, and thou wast worthy
of such a son; a noble specimen wast thou of those strong
single-minded Englishmen, who, without making a parade either of
religion or loyalty, feared God and honoured their king, and were
not particularly friendly to the French, whose vaunting polls
they occasionally broke, as at Minden <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>and at
Malplaquet, to the confusion vast of the eternal foes of the
English land.&nbsp; I, who was so little like thee that thou
understoodst me not, and in whom with justice thou didst feel so
little pride, had yet perception enough to see all thy worth, and
to feel it an honour to be able to call myself thy son; and if at
some no distant time, when the foreign enemy ventures to insult
our shore, I be permitted to break some vaunting poll, it will be
a triumph to me to think that, if thou hadst lived, thou wouldst
have hailed the deed, and mightest yet discover some distant
resemblance to thyself, the day when thou didst all but vanquish
the mighty Brain.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of my brother&rsquo;s taste for
painting, and the progress he had made in that beautiful
art.&nbsp; It is probable that, if circumstances had not
eventually diverted his mind from the pursuit, he would have
attained excellence, and left behind him some enduring monument
of his powers, for he had an imagination to conceive, and that
yet rarer endowment, a hand capable of giving life, body, and
reality to the conceptions of his mind; perhaps he wanted one
thing, the want of which is but too often fatal to the sons of
genius, and without which genius is little more than a splendid
toy in the hands of the possessor&mdash;perseverance, dogged
perseverance, in his proper calling; otherwise, though the grave
had closed over him, he might still be living in the admiration
of his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; O ye gifted ones, follow your
calling, for, however various your talents may be, ye can have
but one calling capable of leading ye to eminence and renown;
follow resolutely the one straight path before you, it is that of
your good angel, let neither obstacles nor temptations induce
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>ye to leave it; bound along if you can; if not, on
hands and knees follow it, perish in it, if needful; but ye need
not fear that; no one ever yet died in the true path of his
calling before he had attained the pinnacle.&nbsp; Turn into
other paths, and for a momentary advantage or gratification ye
have sold your inheritance, your immortality.&nbsp; Ye will never
be heard of after death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has given me a hundred and fifty
pounds,&rdquo; said my brother to me one morning, &ldquo;and
something which is better&mdash;his blessing.&nbsp; I am going to
leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? to the great city; to London, to be
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said my brother; &ldquo;what should you do
there?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be discouraged; I dare say a time
will come when you too will go to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, sure enough, so it did, and all but too soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you purpose doing there?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I go to improve myself in art, to place myself
under some master of high name, at least I hope to do so
eventually.&nbsp; I have, however, a plan in my head, which I
should wish first to execute; indeed, I do not think I can rest
till I have done so; every one talks so much about Italy, and the
wondrous artists which it has produced, and the wondrous pictures
which are to be found there; now I wish to see Italy, or rather
Rome, the great city, for I am told that in a certain room there
is contained the grand miracle of art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;The Transfiguration, painted by one Rafael, and
it is said to be the greatest work of the greatest painter which
the world has ever known.&nbsp; I suppose it is because everybody
says so, that I have such a strange desire to see it.&nbsp; I
have already made myself well acquainted with its locality, and
think that I could almost find my way to it blindfold.&nbsp; When
I have crossed the Tiber, which, as you are aware, runs through
Rome, I must presently turn to the right, up a rather shabby
street, which communicates with a large square, the farther end
of which is entirely occupied by the front of an immense church,
with a dome, which ascends almost to the clouds, and this church
they call St. Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have read about that in
&lsquo;Keysler&rsquo;s Travels.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the church, in the square, are two fountains,
one on either side, casting up water in showers; between them, in
the midst, is an obelisk, brought from Egypt, and covered with
mysterious writing; on your right rises an edifice, not beautiful
nor grand, but huge and bulky, where lives a strange kind of
priest whom men call the Pope, a very horrible old individual,
who would fain keep Christ in leading strings, calls the Virgin
Mary the Queen of Heaven, and himself God&rsquo;s
Lieutenant-General upon earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have read of him in
&lsquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not go straight forward up the flight of
steps conducting into the church, but I turn to the right, and,
passing under the piazza, find myself in a court of the huge
bulky house; and then ascend various staircases, and pass along
various <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>corridors and galleries, all of
which I could describe to you, though I have never seen them; at
last a door is unlocked, and we enter a room rather high, but not
particularly large, communicating with another room, into which,
however, I do not go, though there are noble things in that
second room&mdash;immortal things, by immortal artists; amongst
others, a grand piece of Corregio; I do not enter it, for the
grand picture of the world is not there; but I stand still
immediately on entering the first room, and I look straight
before me, neither to the right nor left, though there are noble
things both on the right and left, for immediately before me at
the farther end, hanging against the wall, is a picture which
arrests me, and I can see nothing else, for that picture at the
farther end hanging against the wall is the picture of the world
. . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, go thy way, young enthusiast, and, whether to London town
or to old Rome, may success attend thee; yet strange fears assail
me and misgivings on thy account.&nbsp; Thou canst not rest, thou
sayest, till thou hast seen the picture in the chamber at old
Rome hanging over against the wall; ay, and thus thou dost
exemplify thy weakness&mdash;thy strength too, it may
be&mdash;for the one idea, fantastic yet lovely, which now
possesses thee, could only have originated in a genial and
fervent brain.&nbsp; Well, go, if thou must go; yet it perhaps
were better for thee to bide in thy native land, and there, with
fear and trembling, with groanings, with straining eyeballs,
toil, drudge, slave, till thou hast made excellence thine own;
thou wilt scarcely acquire it by staring at the picture over
against the door in the high chamber of old Rome.&nbsp; Seekest
thou inspiration? thou needest it not, thou <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>hast it
already; and it was never yet found by crossing the sea.&nbsp;
What hast thou to do with old Rome, and thou an Englishman?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did thy blood never glow at the mention of thy native
land?&rdquo; as an artist merely?&nbsp; Yes, I trow, and with
reason, for thy native land need not grudge old Rome her
&ldquo;pictures of the world&rdquo;; she has pictures of her own,
&ldquo;pictures of England&rdquo;; and is it a new thing to toss
up caps and shout&mdash;England against the world?&nbsp; Yes,
against the world in all, in all; in science and in arms, in
minstrel strain, and not less in the art &ldquo;which enables the
hand to deceive the intoxicated soul by means of pictures.&rdquo;
<a name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"

and Hogarth turn, not names of the world, may be, but English
names&mdash;and England against the world!&nbsp; A living master?
why, there he comes! thou hast had him long, he has long guided
thy young hand towards the excellence which is yet far from thee,
but which thou canst attain if thou shouldst persist and wrestle,
even as he has done, &rsquo;midst gloom and despondency&mdash;ay,
and even contempt; he who now comes up the creaking stair to thy
little studio in the second floor to inspect thy last effort
before thou departest, the little stout man whose face is very
dark, and whose eye is vivacious; that man has attained
excellence, destined some day to be acknowledged, though not till
he is cold, and his mortal part returned to its kindred
clay.&nbsp; He has painted, not pictures of the world, but
English pictures, such as Gainsborough himself might have done;
beautiful rural pieces, with trees which might well tempt the
wild birds to perch upon them: thou needest not run to Rome,
brother, where lives the <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>old
Mariolater, after pictures of the world, whilst at home there are
pictures of England; nor needest thou even go to London, the big
city, in search of a master, for thou hast one at home in the old
East Anglian town who can instruct thee whilst thou needest
instruction: better stay at home, brother, at least for a season,
and toil and strive &rsquo;midst groanings and despondency till
thou hast attained excellence even as he has done&mdash;the
little dark man with the brown coat and the top-boots, whose name
will one day be considered the chief ornament of the old town,
and whose works will at no distant period rank amongst the
proudest pictures of England&mdash;and England against the
world!&mdash;thy master, my brother, thy, at present, all too
little considered master&mdash;Crome. <a

Condition&mdash;Draoitheac&mdash;A Dilemma&mdash;The

<p>But to proceed with my own story; I now ceased all at once to
take much pleasure in the pursuits which formerly interested me,
I yawned over Ab Gwilym, even as I now in my mind&rsquo;s eye
perceive the reader yawning over the present pages.&nbsp; What
was the cause of this?&nbsp; Constitutional lassitude, or a
desire for novelty?&nbsp; Both it is probable had some influence
in the matter, but I rather think that the latter feeling was
predominant.&nbsp; The parting words of my brother had sunk into
my mind.&nbsp; He had talked of travelling in strange regions and
seeing strange and wonderful objects, and my imagination fell to
work and drew pictures of adventures wild and fantastic, and I
thought what a fine thing it must be to travel, and I wished that
my father would give me his blessing, and the same sum that he
had given my brother, and bid me go forth into the world; always
forgetting that I had neither talents nor energies at this period
which would enable me to make any successful figure on its
stage.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>And then I again sought up the book which had so
captivated me in my infancy, and I read it through; and I sought
up others of a similar character, and in seeking for them I met
books also of adventure, but by no means of a harmless
description, lives of wicked and lawless men, Murray and
Latroon&mdash;books of singular power, but of coarse and prurient
imagination&mdash;books at one time highly in vogue; now
deservedly forgotten, and most difficult to be found.</p>
<p>And when I had gone through these books, what was my state of
mind?&nbsp; I had derived entertainment from their perusal, but
they left me more listless and unsettled than before, and I
really knew not what to do to pass my time.&nbsp; My philological
studies had become distasteful, and I had never taken any
pleasure in the duties of my profession.&nbsp; I sat behind my
desk in a state of torpor, my mind almost as blank as the paper
before me, on which I rarely traced a line.&nbsp; It was always a
relief to hear the bell ring, as it afforded me an opportunity of
doing something which I was yet capable of doing, to rise and
open the door and stare in the countenances of the
visitors.&nbsp; All of a sudden I fell to studying countenances,
and soon flattered myself that I had made considerable progress
in the science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no faith in countenances,&rdquo; said some
Roman of old; &ldquo;trust anything but a person&rsquo;s
countenance.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not trust a man&rsquo;s
countenance?&rdquo; say some moderns; &ldquo;why, it is the only
thing in many people that we can trust; on which account they
keep it most assiduously out of the way.&nbsp; Trust not a
man&rsquo;s words if you please, or you may come to very
erroneous conclusions; but at all <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>times place
implicit confidence in a man&rsquo;s countenance, in which there
is no deceit; and of necessity there can be none.&nbsp; If people
would but look each other more in the face, we should have less
cause to complain of the deception of the world; nothing so easy
as physiognomy nor so useful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Somewhat in this
latter strain I thought at the time of which I am speaking.&nbsp;
I am now older, and, let us hope, less presumptuous.&nbsp; It is
true that in the course of my life I have scarcely ever had
occasion to repent placing confidence in individuals whose
countenances have prepossessed me in their favour; though to how
many I may have been unjust, from whose countenances I may have
drawn unfavourable conclusions, is another matter.</p>
<p>But it had been decreed by that Fate which governs our every
action, that I was soon to return to my old pursuits.&nbsp; It
was written that I should not yet cease to be Lav-engro, though I
had become, in my own opinion, a kind of Lavater.&nbsp; It is
singular enough that my renewed ardour for philology seems to
have been brought about indirectly by my physiognomical
researches, in which had I not indulged, the event which I am
about to relate, as far as connected with myself, might never
have occurred.&nbsp; Amongst the various countenances which I
admitted during the period of my answering the bell, there were
two which particularly pleased me, and which belonged to an
elderly yeoman and his wife, whom some little business had
brought to our law sanctuary.&nbsp; I believe they experienced
from me some kindness and attention, which won the old
people&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; So, one day, when their little
business had been brought to a conclusion, and they chanced to be
<!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>alone with me, who was seated as usual behind the deal
desk in the outer room, the old man with some confusion began to
tell me how grateful himself and dame felt for the many
attentions I had shown them, and how desirous they were to make
me some remuneration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;we must be cautious what we offer to so fine a young
gentleman as yourself; we have, however, something we think will
just suit the occasion, a strange kind of thing which people say
is a book, though no one that my dame or myself have shown it to
can make anything out of it; so as we are told that you are a
fine young gentleman, who can read all the tongues of the earth
and stars, as the Bible says, we thought, I and my dame, that it
would be just the thing you would like; and my dame has it now at
the bottom of her basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A book!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;how did you come by
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live near the sea,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;so near that sometimes our thatch is wet with the spray;
and it may now be a year ago that there was a fearful storm, and
a ship was driven ashore during the night, and ere the morn was a
complete wreck.&nbsp; When we got up at daylight, there were the
poor shivering crew at our door; they were foreigners, red-haired
men, whose speech we did not understand; but we took them in, and
warmed them, and they remained with us three days; and when they
went away they left behind them this thing, here it is, part of
the contents of a box which was washed ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you learn who they were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; they made us understand that they were
Danes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Danes! thought I, Danes! and instantaneously, huge and
grizzly, appeared to rise up before my vision the skull of the
old pirate Dane, even as I had seen it of yore in the pent-house
of the ancient church to which, with my mother and my brother, I
had wandered on the memorable summer eve.</p>
<p>And now the old man handed me the book; a strange and
uncouth-looking volume enough.&nbsp; It was not very large, but
instead of the usual covering was bound in wood, and was
compressed with strong iron clasps.&nbsp; It was a printed book,
but the pages were not of paper, but vellum, and the characters
were black, and resembled those generally termed Gothic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly a curious book,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and I should like to have it; but I can&rsquo;t think of
taking it as a gift; I must give you an equivalent; I never take
presents from anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man whispered with his dame and chuckled, and then
turned his face to me, and said, with another chuckle,
&ldquo;Well, we have agreed about the price, but, may be, you
will not consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what do you
demand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that you shake me by the hand, and hold out your
cheek to my old dame,&mdash;she has taken an affection to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to shake you by the hand,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but as for the other condition, it requires
consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No consideration at all,&rdquo; said the old man, with
something like a sigh; &ldquo;she thinks you like her son, our
only child, that was lost twenty years ago in the waves of the
North Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>&ldquo;Oh, that alters the case altogether,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and of course I can have no objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now at once I shook off my listlessness, to enable me to
do which nothing could have happened more opportune than the
above event.&nbsp; The Danes, the Danes!&nbsp; And was I at last
to become acquainted, and in so singular a manner, with the
speech of a people which had as far back as I could remember
exercised the strongest influence over my imagination, as how
should they not!&mdash;in infancy there was the summer-eve
adventure, to which I often looked back, and always with a kind
of strange interest, with respect to those to whom such gigantic
and wondrous bones could belong as I had seen on that occasion;
and, more than this, I had been in Ireland, and there, under
peculiar circumstances, this same interest was increased
tenfold.&nbsp; I had mingled much whilst there with the genuine
Irish&mdash;a wild, but kind-hearted race, whose conversation was
deeply imbued with traditionary lore, connected with the early
history of their own romantic land, and from them I heard enough
of the Danes, but nothing commonplace, for they never mentioned
them but in terms which tallied well with my own preconceived
ideas.&nbsp; For at an early period the Danes had invaded
Ireland, and had subdued it, and, though eventually driven out,
had left behind them an enduring remembrance in the minds of the
people, who loved to speak of their strength and their stature,
in evidence of which they would point to the ancient raths or
mounds, where the old Danes were buried, and where bones of
extraordinary size were occasionally exhumed.&nbsp; And as the
Danes surpassed other people in strength, so, according to my
<!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>narrators, they also excelled all others in wisdom, or
rather in Draoitheac, or magic, for they were powerful sorcerers,
they said, compared with whom the fairy men of the present day
knew nothing at all, at all; and, amongst other wonderful things,
they knew how to make strong beer from the heather that grows
upon the bogs.&nbsp; Little wonder if the interest, the
mysterious interest, which I had early felt about the Danes, was
increased tenfold by my sojourn in Ireland.</p>
<p>And now I had in my possession a Danish book, which, from its
appearance, might be supposed to have belonged to the very old
Danes indeed; but how was I to turn it to any account?&nbsp; I
had the book, it is true, but I did not understand the language,
and how was I to overcome that difficulty? hardly by poring over
the book; yet I did pore over the book, daily and nightly, till
my eyes were dim, and it appeared to me that every now and then I
encountered words which I understood&mdash;English words, though
strangely disguised; and I said to myself, courage!&nbsp; English
and Danish are cognate dialects, a time will come when I shall
understand this Danish; and then I pored over the book again, but
with all my poring I could not understand it; and then I became
angry, and I bit my lips till the blood came; and I occasionally
tore a handful from my hair, and flung it upon the floor, but
that did not mend the matter, for still I did not understand the
book, which, however, I began to see was written in rhyme&mdash;a
circumstance rather difficult to discover at first, the
arrangement of the lines not differing from that which is
employed in prose; and its being written in rhyme made me only
the more eager to understand it.</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>But I toiled in vain, for I had neither grammar nor
dictionary of the language; and when I sought for them could
procure neither; and I was much dispirited, till suddenly a
bright thought came into my head, and I said, although I cannot
obtain a dictionary or grammar, I can perhaps obtain a Bible in
this language, and if I can procure a Bible, I can learn the
language, for the Bible in every tongue contains the same thing,
and I have only to compare the words of the Danish Bible with
those of the English, and, if I persevere, I shall in time
acquire the language of the Danes; and I was pleased with the
thought, which I considered to be a bright one, and I no longer
bit my lips, or tore my hair, but I took my hat, and, going
forth, I flung my hat into the air.</p>
<p>And when my hat came down, I put it on my head and commenced
running, directing my course to the house of the Antinomian
preacher, who sold books, and whom I knew to have Bibles in
various tongues amongst the number, and I arrived out of breath,
and I found the Antinomian in his little library, dusting his
books; and the Antinomian clergyman was a tall man of about
seventy, who wore a hat with a broad brim and a shallow crown,
and whose manner of speaking was exceedingly nasal; and when I
saw him, I cried, out of breath, &ldquo;Have you a Danish
Bible?&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;What do you want it for,
friend?&rdquo; and I answered, &ldquo;To learn Danish by;&rdquo;
&ldquo;And may be to learn thy duty,&rdquo; replied the
Antinomian preacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly, I have it not, but, as
you are a customer of mine, I will endeavour to procure you one,
and I will write to that laudable society which men call the
Bible Society, an unworthy member of which <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>I am, and I
hope by next week to procure what you desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when I heard these words of the old man, I was very glad,
and my heart yearned towards him, and I would fain enter into
conversation with him; and I said, &ldquo;Why are you an
Antinomian?&nbsp; For my part I would rather be a dog than belong
to such a religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, friend,&rdquo; said
the Antinomian, &ldquo;thou forejudgest us; know that those who
call us Antinomians call us so despitefully; we do not
acknowledge the designation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you do not
set all law at nought?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Far be it from
us,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;we only hope that, being
sanctified by the Spirit from above, we have no need of the law
to keep us in order.&nbsp; Did you ever hear tell of Lodowick
Muggleton?&rdquo; <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
I.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is strange; know then that he was the
founder of our poor society, and after him we are frequently,
though opprobriously, termed Muggletonians, for we are
Christians.&nbsp; Here is his book, which, perhaps, you can do no
better than purchase; you are fond of rare books, and this is
both curious and rare; I will sell it cheap.&nbsp; Thank you, and
now be gone; I will do all I can to procure the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in this manner I procured the Danish Bible, and I
commenced my task; first of all, however, I locked up in a closet
the volume which had excited my curiosity, saying, &ldquo;Out of
this closet thou comest not till I deem myself competent to read
thee,&rdquo; and then I sat down in right earnest, comparing
every line in the one version with the corresponding one in the
other; and I passed <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>entire nights in this manner, till I
was almost blind, and the task was tedious enough at first, but I
quailed not, and soon began to make progress: and at first I had
a misgiving that the old book might not prove a Danish book, but
was soon reassured by reading many words in the Bible which I
remembered to have seen in the book; and then I went on right
merrily, and I found that the language which I was studying was
by no means a difficult one, and in less than a month I deemed
myself able to read the book.</p>
<p>Anon, I took the book from the closet, and proceeded to make
myself master of its contents; I had some difficulty, for the
language of the book, though in the main the same as the language
of the Bible, differed from it in some points, being apparently a
more ancient dialect; by degrees, however, I overcame this
difficulty, and I understood the contents of the book, and well
did they correspond with all those ideas in which I had indulged
connected with the Danes.&nbsp; For the book was a book of
ballads, about the deeds of knights and champions, and men of
huge stature; ballads which from time immemorial had been sung in
the North, and which some two centuries before the time of which
I am speaking had been collected by one Anders Vedel, who lived
with a certain Tycho Brahe, and assisted him in making
observations upon the heavenly bodies, at a place called Uranias
Castle, on the little island of Hveen, in the Cattegat.</p>

Yourself in German.</p>
<p>It might be some six months after the events last recorded,
that two individuals were seated together in a certain room, in a
certain street of the old town which I have so frequently had
occasion to mention in the preceding pages; one of them was an
elderly, and the other a very young man, and they sat on either
side of a fireplace, beside a table, on which were fruit and
wine; the room was a small one, and in its furniture exhibited
nothing remarkable.&nbsp; Over the mantelpiece, however, hung a
small picture with naked figures in the foreground, and with much
foliage behind.&nbsp; It might not have struck every beholder,
for it looked old and smoke-dried; but a connoisseur, on
inspecting it closely, would have pronounced it to be a Judgment
of Paris, and a masterpiece of the Flemish school.</p>
<p>The forehead of the elder individual was high, and perhaps
appeared more so than it really was, from the hair being
carefully brushed back, as if <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>for the
purpose of displaying to the best advantage that part of the
cranium; his eyes were large and full, and of a light brown, and
might have been called heavy and dull, had they not been
occasionally lighted up by a sudden gleam&mdash;not so brilliant,
however, as that which at every inhalation shone from the bowl of
the long clay pipe which he was smoking, but which, from a
certain sucking sound which about this time began to be heard
from the bottom, appeared to be giving notice that it would soon
require replenishment from a certain canister, which, together
with a lighted taper, stood upon the table beside him. <a
name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not smoke?&rdquo; said he, at length, laying
down his pipe, and directing his glance to his companion.</p>
<p>Now there was at least one thing singular connected with this
last, namely, the colour of his hair, which, notwithstanding his
extreme youth, appeared to be rapidly becoming grey.&nbsp; He had
very long limbs, and was apparently tall of stature, in which he
differed from his elderly companion, who must have been somewhat
below the usual height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t smoke,&rdquo; said the youth, in
reply to the observation of the other; &ldquo;I have often tried,
but could never succeed to my satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible to become a good German without
smoking?&rdquo; said the senior, half speaking to himself.</p>
<p><!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; said the youth;
&ldquo;but I shan&rsquo;t break my heart on that
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for breaking your heart, of course you would never
think of such a thing; he is a fool who breaks his heart on any
account; but it is good to be a German, the Germans are the most
philosophic people in the world, and the greatest smokers: now I
trace their philosophy to their smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard say their philosophy is all smoke&mdash;is
that your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no; but smoking has a sedative effect upon the
nerves, and enables a man to bear the sorrows of this life (of
which every one has his share) not only decently, but
dignifiedly.&nbsp; Suicide is not a national habit in Germany as
it is in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that poor creature, Werther, who committed suicide,
was a German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Werther is a fictitious character, and by no means a
felicitous one; I am no admirer either of Werther or his
author.&nbsp; But I should say that, if there ever was a Werther
in Germany, he did not smoke.&nbsp; Werther, as you very justly
observe, was a poor creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very sinful one; I have heard my parents say that
suicide is a great crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broadly, and without qualification, to say that suicide
is a crime, is speaking somewhat unphilosophically.&nbsp; No
doubt suicide, under many circumstances, is a crime, a very
heinous one.&nbsp; When the father of a family, for example, to
escape from certain difficulties, commits suicide, he commits a
crime; there are those around him who look to him for support, by
the law of nature, and he has <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>no right to
withdraw himself from those who have a claim upon his exertions;
he is a person who decamps with other people&rsquo;s goods as
well as his own.&nbsp; Indeed, there can be no crime which is not
founded upon the depriving others of something which belongs to
them.&nbsp; A man is hanged for setting fire to his house in a
crowded city, for he burns at the same time or damages those of
other people; but if a man who has a house on a heath sets fire
to it, he is not hanged, for he has not damaged or endangered any
other individual&rsquo;s property, and the principle of revenge,
upon which all punishment is founded, has not been aroused.&nbsp;
Similar to such a case is that of the man who, without any family
ties, commits suicide; for example, were I to do the thing this
evening, who would have a right to call me to account?&nbsp; I am
alone in the world, have no family to support, and, so far from
damaging any one, should even benefit my heir by my accelerated
death.&nbsp; However, I am no advocate for suicide under any
circumstances; there is something undignified in it, unheroic,
un-Germanic.&nbsp; But if you must commit suicide&mdash;and there
is no knowing to what people may be brought&mdash;always contrive
to do it as decorously as possible; the decencies, whether of
life or of death, should never be lost sight of.&nbsp; I remember
a female Quaker who committed suicide by cutting her throat, but
she did it decorously and decently: kneeling down over a pail, so
that not one drop fell upon the floor; thus exhibiting in her
last act that nice sense of neatness for which Quakers are
distinguished.&nbsp; I have always had a respect for that
woman&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here, filling his pipe
from the canister, and <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>lighting it
at the taper, he recommenced smoking calmly and sedately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is not suicide forbidden in the Bible?&rdquo; the
youth demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no; but what though it were!&mdash;the Bible is a
respectable book, but I should hardly call it one whose
philosophy is of the soundest.&nbsp; I have said that it is a
respectable book; I mean respectable from its antiquity, and from
containing, as Herder says, &lsquo;the earliest records of the
human race,&rsquo; though those records are far from being
dispassionately written, on which account they are of less value
than they otherwise might have been.&nbsp; There is too much
passion in the Bible, too much violence; now, to come to all
truth, especially historic truth, requires cool dispassionate
investigation, for which the Jews do not appear to have ever been
famous.&nbsp; We are ourselves not famous for it, for we are a
passionate people; the Germans are not&mdash;they are not a
passionate people&mdash;a people celebrated for their oaths; we
are.&nbsp; The Germans have many excellent historic writers, we .
. . &rsquo;tis true we have Gibbon . . . You have been reading
Gibbon&mdash;what do you think of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think him a very wonderful writer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a wonderful writer&mdash;one <i>sui
generis</i>&mdash;uniting the perspicuity of the
English&mdash;for we are perspicuous&mdash;with the cool
dispassionate reasoning of the Germans.&nbsp; Gibbon sought after
the truth, found it, and made it clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think Gibbon a truthful writer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; who shall convict Gibbon of falsehood?&nbsp;
Many people have endeavoured to convict Gibbon of falsehood; they
have followed him in his researches, and have never found him
<!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>once tripping.&nbsp; Oh, he is a wonderful writer! his
power of condensation is admirable; the lore of the whole world
is to be found in his pages.&nbsp; Sometimes in a single note, he
has given us the result of the study of years; or, to speak
metaphorically, &lsquo;he has ransacked a thousand Gulistans, and
has condensed all his fragrant booty into a single drop of
otto.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was not Gibbon an enemy to the Christian
faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no; he was rather an enemy to priestcraft, so am
I; and when I say the philosophy of the Bible is in many respects
unsound, I always wish to make an exception in favour of that
part of it which contains the life and sayings of Jesus of
Bethlehem, to which I must always concede my unqualified
admiration&mdash;of Jesus, mind you; for with his followers and
their dogmas I have nothing to do.&nbsp; Of all historic
characters Jesus is the most beautiful and the most heroic.&nbsp;
I have always been a friend to hero-worship, it is the only
rational one, and has always been in use amongst civilised
people&mdash;the worship of spirits is synonymous with
barbarism&mdash;it is mere fetish; the savages of West Africa are
all spirit worshippers.&nbsp; But there is something philosophic
in the worship of the heroes of the human race, and the true hero
is the benefactor.&nbsp; Brahma, Jupiter, Bacchus, were all
benefactors, and, therefore, entitled to the worship of their
respective peoples.&nbsp; The Celts worshipped Hesus, who taught
them to plough, a highly useful art.&nbsp; We, who have attained
a much higher state of civilisation than the Celts ever did,
worship Jesus, the first who endeavoured to teach men to behave
decently and decorously under all <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>circumstances; who was the foe of vengeance, in which
there is something highly indecorous; who had first the courage
to lift his voice against that violent dogma, &lsquo;an eye for
an eye&rsquo;; who shouted conquer, but conquer with kindness;
who said put up the sword, a violent unphilosophic weapon; and
who finally died calmly and decorously in defence of his
philosophy.&nbsp; He must be a savage who denies worship to the
hero of Golgotha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But He was something more than a hero; He was the Son
of God, wasn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elderly individual made no immediate answer; but, after a
few more whiffs from his pipe, exclaimed, &ldquo;Come, fill your
glass!&nbsp; How do you advance with your translation of
Tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nearly finished; but I do not think I shall
proceed with it; I begin to think the original somewhat
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are wrong; it is the masterpiece of Schiller,
the first of German poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said the youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
pray excuse me, I do not think very highly of German
poetry.&nbsp; I have lately been reading Shakespeare; and, when I
turn from him to the Germans&mdash;even the best of
them&mdash;they appear mere pigmies.&nbsp; You will pardon the
liberty I perhaps take in saying so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that every one should have an opinion of his
own,&rdquo; said the elderly individual; &ldquo;and, what is
more, declare it.&nbsp; Nothing displeases me more than to see
people assenting to everything that they hear said; I at once
come to the conclusion that they are either hypocrites, or there
is nothing in them.&nbsp; But, with respect to Shakespeare, whom
I have not read for thirty years, is he not rather <!-- page
217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>given to bombast, &lsquo;crackling bombast,&rsquo; as I
think I have said in one of my essays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say he is,&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t help thinking him the greatest of all poets, not even
excepting Homer.&nbsp; I would sooner have written that series of
plays, founded on the fortunes of the House of Lancaster, than
the Iliad itself.&nbsp; The events described are as lofty as
those sung by Homer in his great work, and the characters brought
upon the stage still more interesting.&nbsp; I think Hotspur as
much of a hero as Hector, and young Henry more of a man than
Achilles; and then there is the fat knight, the quintessence of
fun, wit, and rascality.&nbsp; Falstaff is a creation beyond the
genius even of Homer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost tempt me to read Shakespeare again&mdash;but
the Germans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admire the Germans,&rdquo; said the
youth, somewhat excited.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admire them
in any point of view.&nbsp; I have heard my father say that,
though good sharpshooters, they can&rsquo;t be much depended upon
as soldiers; and that old Sergeant Meredith told him that Minden
would never have been won but for the two English regiments, who
charged the French with fixed bayonets, and sent them to the
right-about in double-quick time.&nbsp; With respect to poetry,
setting Shakespeare and the English altogether aside, I think
there is another Gothic nation, at least, entitled to dispute
with them the palm.&nbsp; Indeed, to my mind, there is more
genuine poetry contained in the old Danish book which I came so
strangely by, than has been produced in Germany from the period
of the Niebelungen lay to the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the K&oelig;mpe Viser?&rdquo; said the elderly <!--
page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>individual, breathing forth an immense volume of smoke,
which he had been collecting during the declamation of his young
companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are singular things in that book, I
must confess; and I thank you for showing it to me, or rather
your attempt at translation.&nbsp; I was struck with that ballad
of Orm Ungarswayne, who goes by night to the grave-hill of his
father to seek for counsel.&nbsp; And then, again, that strange
melancholy Swayne Vonved, who roams about the world propounding
people riddles; slaying those who cannot answer, and rewarding
those who can with golden bracelets.&nbsp; Were it not for the
violence, I should say that ballad has a philosophic
tendency.&nbsp; I thank you for making me acquainted with the
book, and I thank the Jew Mousha for making me acquainted with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Mousha was a strange customer,&rdquo; said the
youth, collecting himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>was</i> a strange customer,&rdquo; said the elder
individual, breathing forth a gentle cloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love
to exercise hospitality to wandering strangers, especially
foreigners; and when he came to this place, pretending to teach
German and Hebrew, I asked him to dinner.&nbsp; After the first
dinner, he asked me to lend him five pounds; I <i>did</i> lend
him five pounds.&nbsp; After the fifth dinner, he asked me to
lend him fifty pounds; I did <i>not</i> lend him the fifty
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was as ignorant of German as of Hebrew,&rdquo; said
the youth; &ldquo;on which account he was soon glad, I suppose,
to transfer his pupil to some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me,&rdquo; said the elder individual,
&ldquo;that he intended to leave a town where he did not find
<!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>sufficient encouragement; and, at the same time,
expressed regret at being obliged to abandon a certain
extraordinary pupil, for whom he had a particular regard.&nbsp;
Now I, who have taught many people German from the love which I
bear to it, and the desire which I feel that it should be
generally diffused, instantly said, that I should be happy to
take his pupil off his hands, and afford him what instruction I
could in German, for, as to Hebrew, I have never taken much
interest in it.&nbsp; Such was the origin of our
acquaintance.&nbsp; You have been an apt scholar.&nbsp; Of late,
however, I have seen little of you&mdash;what is the
reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, probably, that you have learned all I can
teach you?&nbsp; Well, perhaps you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, not so,&rdquo; said the young man, eagerly;
&ldquo;before I knew you I knew nothing, and am still very
ignorant; but of late my father&rsquo;s health has been very much
broken, and he requires attention; his spirits also have become
low, which, to tell you the truth, he attributes to my
misconduct.&nbsp; He says that I have imbibed all kinds of
strange notions and doctrines, which will, in all probability,
prove my ruin, both here and hereafter;
which&mdash;which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I understand,&rdquo; said the elder, with
another calm whiff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have always had a kind of
respect for your father, for there is something remarkable in his
appearance, something heroic, and I would fain have cultivated
his acquaintance; the feeling, however, has not been
reciprocated.&nbsp; I met him, the other day, up the road, with
his cane and dog, and saluted him; he did not return my
salutation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has certain opinions of his own,&rdquo; said the
<!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>youth, &ldquo;which are widely different from those
which he has heard that you profess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I respect a man for entertaining an opinion of his
own,&rdquo; said the elderly individual.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hold
certain opinions; but I should not respect an individual the more
for adopting them.&nbsp; All I wish for is tolerance, which I
myself endeavour to practise.&nbsp; I have always loved the
truth, and sought it; if I have not found it, the greater my
misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no!&nbsp; And, between ourselves, it is that which
induces me to doubt sometimes the truth of my opinions.&nbsp; My
life, upon the whole, I consider a failure; on which account, I
would not counsel you, or any one, to follow my example too
closely.&nbsp; It is getting late, and you had better be going,
especially as your father, you say, is anxious about you.&nbsp;
But, as we may never meet again, I think there are three things
which I may safely venture to press upon you.&nbsp; The first is,
that the decencies and gentlenesses should never be lost sight
of, as the practice of the decencies and gentlenesses is at all
times compatible with independence of thought and action.&nbsp;
The second thing which I would wish to impress upon you, is, that
there is always some eye upon us; and that it is impossible to
keep anything we do from the world, as it will assuredly be
divulged by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do
so.&nbsp; The third thing which I would wish to press upon
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the youth, eagerly bending
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&rdquo;&mdash;and here the elderly individual laid
down his pipe upon the table&mdash;&ldquo;that it will be as well
to go on improving yourself in German!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Alehouse Keeper&mdash;Compassion for the Rich&mdash;Old
English Gentleman&mdash;How is This?&mdash;Madeira&mdash;The
Greek Parr&mdash;Twenty Languages&mdash;Whiter&rsquo;s
Health&mdash;About the Fight&mdash;A Sporting Gentleman&mdash;The
Flattened Nose&mdash;Lend us that Pightle&mdash;The Surly
Nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa, master! can you tell us where the fight is
likely to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the words shouted out to me by a short thick fellow,
in brown top-boots, and bareheaded, who stood, with his hands in
his pockets, at the door of a country alehouse as I was passing
by.</p>
<p>Now, as I knew nothing about the fight, and as the appearance
of the man did not tempt me greatly to enter into conversation
with him, I merely answered in the negative, and continued my
way.</p>
<p>It was a fine lovely morning in May, the sun shone bright
above, and the birds were carolling in the hedge-rows.&nbsp; I
was wont to be cheerful at such seasons, for, from my earliest
recollection, sunshine and the song of birds have been dear to
me; yet, about that period, I was not cheerful, my mind was not
at rest; I was debating within myself, and the debate was dreary
and unsatisfactory enough.&nbsp; I sighed, and turning my eyes
upward, I ejaculated, <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But suddenly, by a violent effort breaking away from my
meditations, I hastened forward; one mile, two miles, three miles
were speedily left behind; and now I came to a grove of birch and
other trees, and opening a gate I passed up a kind of avenue, and
soon arriving before a large brick house, of rather antique
appearance, knocked at the door.</p>
<p>In this house there lived a gentleman with whom I had
business.&nbsp; He was said to be a genuine old English
gentleman, and a man of considerable property; at this time,
however, he wanted a thousand pounds, as gentlemen of
considerable property every now and then do.&nbsp; I had brought
him a thousand pounds in my pocket, for it is astonishing how
many eager helpers the rich find, and with what compassion people
look upon their distresses.&nbsp; He was said to have good wine
in his cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your master at home?&rdquo; said I, to a servant who
appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His worship is at home, young man,&rdquo; said the
servant, as he looked at my shoes, which bore evidence that I had
come walking.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he
added, as he looked me in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, servants,&rdquo; thought I, as I followed the
man into the house, &ldquo;always look people in the face when
you open the door, and do so before you look at their shoes, or
you may mistake the heir of a Prime Minister for a
shopkeeper&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found his worship a jolly, red-faced gentleman, of about
fifty-five; he was dressed in a green coat, white corduroy
breeches, and drab gaiters, and sat <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>on an
old-fashioned leather sofa, with two small, thorough-bred, black
English terriers, one on each side of him.&nbsp; He had all the
appearance of a genuine old English gentleman who kept good wine
in his cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have brought you a
thousand pounds;&rdquo; and I said this after the servant had
retired, and the two terriers had ceased the barking which is
natural to all such dogs at the sight of a stranger.</p>
<p>And when the magistrate had received the money, and signed and
returned a certain paper which I handed to him, he rubbed his
hands, and looking very benignantly at me, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, young gentleman, that our business is over,
perhaps you can tell me where the fight is to take
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I
can&rsquo;t inform you, but everybody seems to be anxious about
it;&rdquo; and then I told him what had occurred to me on the
road with the alehouse keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him,&rdquo; said his worship; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
a tenant of mine, and a good fellow, somewhat too much in my debt
though.&nbsp; But how is this, young gentleman? you look as if
you had been walking; you did not come on foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I came on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On foot! why, it is sixteen miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be tired when I have walked
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ride, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than I can walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have frequently to make journeys connected with my
profession; sometimes I walk, sometimes I ride, just as the whim
takes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;Will you take a glass of wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; what shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madeira!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate gave a violent slap on his knee.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
like your taste,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am fond of a glass of
Madeira myself, and can give you such a one as you will not drink
every day; sit down, young gentleman; you shall have a glass of
Madeira, and the best I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he got up, and, followed by his two terriers, walked
slowly out of the room.</p>
<p>I looked round the room, and, seeing nothing which promised me
much amusement, I sat down, and fell again into my former train
of thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said the magistrate, returning at
the end of a quarter of an hour, followed by the servant, with a
tray; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the true thing, or I am no judge, far
less a justice.&nbsp; It has been thirty years in my cellar last
Christmas.&nbsp; There,&rdquo; said he to the servant, &ldquo;put
it down, and leave my young friend and me to ourselves.&nbsp;
Now, what do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever taste better Madeira?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never before tasted Madeira.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ask for a wine without knowing what it
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask for it, sir, that I may know what it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is logic in that, as Parr would say; you
have heard of Parr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Parr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old Parr, but not that Parr; you mean <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>the English, I the Greek Parr, <a
name="citation225a"></a><a href="#footnote225a"
class="citation">[225a]</a> as people call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not&mdash;rather too young for that, but were
you of my age, you might have cause to know him, coming from
where you do.&nbsp; He kept school there&mdash;I was his first
scholar; he flogged Greek into me till I loved him&mdash;and he
loved me: he came to see me last year, and sat in that chair; I
honour Parr&mdash;he knows much, and is a sound man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know the truth; he knows what&rsquo;s good, from an
oyster to an ostrich&mdash;he&rsquo;s not only sound, but
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we drink his health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, boy: here&rsquo;s Parr&rsquo;s health, and
Whiter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Whiter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know Whiter?&nbsp; I thought everybody
knew Reverend Whiter the philologist, <a
name="citation225b"></a><a href="#footnote225b"
class="citation">[225b]</a> though I suppose you scarcely know
what that means.&nbsp; A man fond of tongues and languages, quite
out of your way&mdash;he understands some twenty; what do you say
to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a sound man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, I scarcely know what to say: he has
got queer notions in his head&mdash;wrote a book to prove that
all words came originally from the earth&mdash;who knows?&nbsp;
Words have roots, and roots live in the earth; but, upon the
whole, I should not call him altogether a sound man, though he
can talk Greek nearly as fast as Parr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a round man?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&ldquo;Ay, boy, rounder than Parr; I&rsquo;ll sing you
a song, if you like, which will let you into his
character:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Give me the haunch of a buck to eat, and to
drink Madeira old,<br />
And a gentle wife to rest with, and in my arms to fold,<br />
An Arabic book to study, a Norfolk cob to ride,<br />
And a house to live in shaded with trees, and near to a river
side;<br />
With such good things around me, and blessed with good health
withal,<br />
Though I should live for a hundred years, for death I would not
call.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to Whiter&rsquo;s health&mdash;so you know
nothing about the fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; the truth is, that of late I have been very
much occupied with various matters, otherwise I should, perhaps,
have been able to afford you some information&mdash;boxing is a
noble art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, my boy; I honour you, and provided
your education had been a little less limited, I should have been
glad to see you here in company with Parr and Whiter; both can
box.&nbsp; Boxing is, as you say, a noble art&mdash;a truly
English art; may I never see the day when Englishmen shall feel
ashamed of it, or blacklegs and blackguards bring it into
disgrace.&nbsp; I am a magistrate, and, of course, cannot
patronise the thing very openly, yet I sometimes see a prize
fight: I saw the Game Chicken beat Gulley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see Big Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! why do you ask?&rdquo;&nbsp; But here we heard <!--
page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>a noise, like that of a gig driving up to the door,
which was immediately succeeded by a violent knocking and
ringing, and after a little time, the servant who had admitted me
made his appearance in the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said
he, with a certain eagerness of manner, &ldquo;here are two
gentlemen waiting to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen waiting to speak to me! who are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said the servant;
&ldquo;but they look like sporting gentlemen,
and&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;here he hesitated; &ldquo;from a word
or two they dropped, I almost think that they come about the
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the fight!&rdquo; said the magistrate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No! that can hardly be; however, you had better show them
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heavy steps were now heard ascending the stairs, and the
servant ushered two men into the apartment.&nbsp; Again there was
a barking, but louder than that which had been directed against
myself, for here were two intruders; both of them were remarkable
looking men, but to the foremost of them the most particular
notice may well be accorded: he was a man somewhat under thirty,
and nearly six feet in height.&nbsp; He was dressed in a blue
coat, white corduroy breeches, fastened below the knee with small
golden buttons; on his legs he wore white lamb&rsquo;s-wool
stockings, and on his feet shoes reaching to the ankles; round
his neck was a handkerchief of the blue and bird&rsquo;s eye
pattern; he wore neither whiskers nor moustaches, and appeared
not to delight in hair, that of his head, which was of a light
brown, being closely cropped; the forehead was rather high, but
somewhat <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>narrow; the face neither broad nor
sharp, perhaps rather sharp than broad; the nose was almost
delicate; the eyes were grey, with an expression in which there
was sternness blended with something approaching to feline; his
complexion was exceedingly pale, relieved, however, by certain
pock-marks, which here and there studded his countenance; his
form was athletic, but lean; his arms long.&nbsp; In the whole
appearance of the man there was a blending of the bluff and the
sharp.&nbsp; You might have supposed him a bruiser; his dress was
that of one in all its minuti&aelig;; something was wanting,
however, in his manner&mdash;the quietness of the professional
man; he rather looked like one performing the
part&mdash;well&mdash;very well&mdash;but still performing a
part.&nbsp; His companion!&mdash;there, indeed, was the
bruiser&mdash;no mistake about him: a tall massive man, with a
broad countenance and a flattened nose; dressed like a bruiser,
but not like a bruiser going into the ring; he wore white-topped
boots, and a loose brown jockey coat.</p>
<p>As the first advanced towards the table, behind which the
magistrate sat, he doffed a white castor from his head, and made
rather a genteel bow; looking at me, who sat somewhat on one
side, he gave a kind of nod of recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I request to know who you are, gentlemen?&rdquo;
said the magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the man in a deep, but not unpleasant
voice, &ldquo;allow me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. ---,
the celebrated pugilist;&rdquo; and he motioned with his hand
towards the massive man with the flattened nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your own name, sir?&rdquo; said the magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is no matter,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;were
<!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>I to mention it to you, it would awaken within you no
feeling of interest.&nbsp; It is neither Kean nor Belcher, and I
have as yet done nothing to distinguish myself like either of
those individuals, or even like my friend here.&nbsp; However, a
time may come&mdash;we are not yet buried; and whensoever my hour
arrives, I hope I shall prove myself equal to my destiny, however
high&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Like bird that&rsquo;s bred amongst the
Helicons.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here a smile half theatrical passed over his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what can I oblige you, sir?&rdquo; said the
magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, the soul of wit is brevity; we want a place
for an approaching combat between my friend here and a brave from
town.&nbsp; Passing by your broad acres this fine morning we saw
a pightle, which we deemed would suit.&nbsp; Lend us that
pightle, and receive our thanks; &rsquo;twould be a favour,
though not much to grant: we neither ask for Stonehenge nor for
Tempe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend looked somewhat perplexed; after a moment, however,
he said, with a firm but gentlemanly air, &ldquo;Sir, I am sorry
that I cannot comply with your request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not comply!&rdquo; said the man, his brow becoming dark
as midnight; and with a hoarse and savage tone, &ldquo;Not
comply! why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible, sir; utterly impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not compelled to give my reasons to you, sir, nor
to any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me beg of you to alter your decision,&rdquo; said
the man, in a tone of profound respect.</p>
<p><!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;Utterly impossible, sir; I am a
magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magistrate! then fare ye well, for a green-coated
buffer and a Harmanbeck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the magistrate, springing up with a
face fiery with wrath.</p>
<p>But, with a surly nod to me, the man left the apartment; and
in a moment more the heavy footsteps of himself and his companion
were heard descending the staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; said my friend, turning towards
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sporting gentleman, well known in the place from
which I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He appeared to know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doubts&mdash;Wise King of Jerusalem&mdash;Let Me See&mdash;A
Thousand Years&mdash;Nothing New&mdash;The Crowd&mdash;The
Hymn&mdash;Faith&mdash;Charles Wesley&mdash;There He
Stood&mdash;Farewell, Brother&mdash;Death&mdash;Sun, Moon, and

<p>There was one question which I was continually asking myself
at this period, and which has more than once met the eyes of the
reader who has followed me through the last chapter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had involved myself
imperceptibly in a dreary labyrinth of doubt, and, whichever way
I turned, no reasonable prospect of extricating myself
appeared.&nbsp; The means by which I had brought myself into this
situation may be very briefly told; I had inquired into many
matters, in order that I might become wise, and I had read and
pondered over the words of the wise, so called, till I had made
myself master of the sum of human wisdom; namely, that every
thing is enigmatical and that man is an enigma to himself; thence
the cry of &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had ceased to
believe in the truth of that in which I had hitherto trusted, and
yet could find nothing in which I could put any fixed or
deliberate belief&mdash;I was, indeed, in a labyrinth!&nbsp; In
what did I not <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>doubt?&nbsp; With respect to crime
and virtue I was in doubt; I doubted that the one was blamable
and the other praiseworthy.&nbsp; Are not all things subjected to
the law of necessity?&nbsp; Assuredly; time and chance govern all
things: yet how can this be? alas!</p>
<p>Then there was myself; for what was I born?&nbsp; Are not all
things born to be forgotten?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s incomprehensible:
yet is it not so?&nbsp; Those butterflies fall and are
forgotten.&nbsp; In what is man better than a butterfly?&nbsp;
All then is born to be forgotten.&nbsp; Ah! that was a pang
indeed; &rsquo;tis at such a moment that a man wishes to
die.&nbsp; The wise king of Jerusalem, who sat in his shady
arbours beside his sunny fish-pools, saying so many fine things,
wished to die, when he saw that not only all was vanity, but that
he himself was vanity.&nbsp; Will a time come when all will be
forgotten that now is beneath the sun?&nbsp; If so, of what
profit is life?</p>
<p>In truth it was a sore vexation of spirit to me when I saw, as
the wise man saw of old, that whatever I could hope to perform
must necessarily be of very temporary duration; and if so, why do
it?&nbsp; I said to myself, whatever name I can acquire, will it
endure for eternity? scarcely so.&nbsp; A thousand years?&nbsp;
Let me see! what have I done already?&nbsp; I have learnt Welsh,
and have translated the songs of Ab Gwilym, some ten thousand
lines, into English rhyme; I have also learnt Danish, and have
rendered the old book of ballads cast by the tempest upon the
beach into corresponding English metre.&nbsp; Good! have I done
enough already to secure myself a reputation of a thousand
years?&nbsp; No, no! certainly not; I have not the slightest
ground for hoping that my translations from the <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>Welsh and Danish will be read at the end of a thousand
years.&nbsp; Well, but I am only eighteen, and I have not stated
all that I have done; I have learnt many other tongues, and have
acquired some knowledge even of Hebrew and Arabic.&nbsp; Should I
go on in this way till I am forty, I must then be very learned;
and perhaps, among other things, may have translated the Talmud,
and some of the great works of the Arabians.&nbsp; Pooh! all this
is mere learning and translation, and such will never secure
immortality.&nbsp; Translation is at best an echo, and it must be
a wonderful echo to be heard after the lapse of a thousand
years.&nbsp; No! all I have already done, and all I may yet do in
the same way, I may reckon as nothing&mdash;mere pastime;
something else must be done.&nbsp; I must either write some grand
original work, or conquer an empire; the one just as easy as the
other.&nbsp; But am I competent to do either?&nbsp; Yes, I think
I am, under favourable circumstances.&nbsp; Yes, I think I may
promise myself a reputation of a thousand years, if I do but give
myself the necessary trouble.&nbsp; Well! but what&rsquo;s a
thousand years after all, or twice a thousand years?&nbsp; Woe is
me!&nbsp; I may just as well sit still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I had never been born!&rdquo; I said to myself;
and a thought would occasionally intrude.&nbsp; But was I ever
born?&nbsp; Is not all that I see a lie&mdash;a deceitful
phantom?&nbsp; Is there a world, and earth, and sky?&nbsp;
Berkeley&rsquo;s doctrine&mdash;Spinosa&rsquo;s doctrine!&nbsp;
Dear reader, I had at that time never read either Berkeley or
Spinosa. <a name="citation233"></a><a href="#footnote233"
class="citation">[233]</a>&nbsp; I have still never read them;
who are they, men of yesterday?&nbsp; &ldquo;All is a
lie&mdash;all a deceitful phantom,&rdquo; are old cries; they
<!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>come naturally from the mouths of those who, casting
aside that choicest shield against madness, simplicity, would
fain be wise as God, and can only know that they are naked.&nbsp;
This doubting in the &ldquo;universal all&rdquo; is almost coeval
with the human race: wisdom, so called, was early sought
after.&nbsp; All is a lie&mdash;a deceitful phantom&mdash;was
said when the world was yet young; its surface, save a scanty
portion, yet untrodden by human foot, and when the great tortoise
yet crawled about.&nbsp; All is a lie, was the doctrine of Buddh;
and Buddh lived thirty centuries before the wise king of
Jerusalem, who sat in his arbours, beside his sunny fish-pools,
saying many fine things, and, amongst others, &ldquo;There is
nothing new under the sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>One day, whilst I bent my way to the heath of which I have
spoken on a former occasion, at the foot of the hills which
formed it I came to a place where a wagon was standing, but
without horses, the shafts resting on the ground; there was a
crowd about it, which extended half-way up the side of the
neighbouring hill.&nbsp; The wagon was occupied by some half a
dozen men&mdash;some sitting, others standing; they were dressed
in sober-coloured habiliments of black or brown, cut in a plain
and rather uncouth fashion, and partially white with dust; their
hair was short, and seemed to have been smoothed down by the
application of the hand; all were bareheaded&mdash;sitting or
standing, all were bareheaded.&nbsp; One of them, a tall man, was
speaking as I arrived; ere, however, I could distinguish what he
was saying, he left off, and then there was a cry for a hymn
&ldquo;to the glory of God&rdquo;&mdash;that was the word.&nbsp;
It was a strange <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>sounding hymn, as well it might be,
for everybody joined in it: there were voices of all kinds, of
men, of women, and of children&mdash;of those who could sing and
of those who could not&mdash;a thousand voices all joined, and
all joined heartily; no voice of all the multitude was silent
save mine.&nbsp; The crowd consisted entirely of the lower
classes, labourers and mechanics, and their wives and
children&mdash;dusty people, unwashed people, people of no
account whatever, and yet they did not look a mob.&nbsp; And when
that hymn was over&mdash;and here let me observe that, strange as
it sounded, I have recalled that hymn to mind, and it has seemed
to tingle in my ears on occasions when all that pomp and art
could do to enhance religious solemnity was being done&mdash;in
the Sistine Chapel, what time the papal band was in full play,
and the choicest choristers of Italy poured forth their mellowest
tones in presence of Batuschca and his cardinals&mdash;on the ice
of the Neva, what time the long train of stately priests, with
their noble beards and their flowing robes of crimson and gold,
with their ebony and ivory staves, stalked along, chanting their
Sclavonian litanies in advance of the mighty Emperor of the North
and his Priberjensky guard of giants, towards the orifice through
which the river, running below in its swiftness, is to receive
the baptismal lymph:&mdash;when the hymn was over, another man in
the wagon proceeded to address the people; he was a much younger
man than the last speaker; somewhat square built and about the
middle height; his face was rather broad, but expressive of much
intelligence, and with a peculiar calm and serious look; the
accent in which he spoke indicated that he was not of these
parts, but <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>from some distant district.&nbsp;
The subject of his address was faith, and how it could remove
mountains.&nbsp; It was a plain address, without any attempt at
ornament, and delivered in a tone which was neither loud nor
vehement.&nbsp; The speaker was evidently not a practised
one&mdash;once or twice he hesitated as if for words to express
his meaning, but still he held on, talking of faith, and how it
could remove mountains: &ldquo;It is the only thing we want,
brethren, in this world; if we have that, we are indeed rich, as
it will enable us to do our duty under all circumstances, and to
bear our lot, however hard it may be&mdash;and the lot of all
mankind is hard&mdash;the lot of the poor is hard,
brethren&mdash;and who knows more of the poor than I?&mdash;a
poor man myself, and the son of a poor man: but are the rich
better off? not so, brethren, for God is just.&nbsp; The rich
have their trials too: I am not rich myself, but I have seen the
rich with careworn countenances; I have also seen them in
madhouses; from which you may learn, brethren, that the lot of
all mankind is hard; that is, till we lay hold of faith, which
makes us comfortable under all circumstances; whether we ride in
gilded chariots or walk barefooted in quest of bread; whether we
be ignorant, whether we be wise&mdash;for riches and poverty,
ignorance and wisdom, brethren, each brings with it its peculiar
temptations.&nbsp; Well, under all these troubles, the thing
which I would recommend you to seek is one and the
same&mdash;faith; faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who made us and
allotted to each his station.&nbsp; Each has something to do,
brethren.&nbsp; Do it, therefore, but always in faith; without
faith we shall find ourselves sometimes at fault; but with faith
never&mdash;for faith can <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>remove the
difficulty.&nbsp; It will teach us to love life, brethren, when
life is becoming bitter, and to prize the blessings around us;
for as every man has his cares, brethren, so has each man his
blessings.&nbsp; It will likewise teach us not to love life over
much, seeing that we must one day part with it.&nbsp; It will
teach us to face death with resignation, and will preserve us
from sinking amidst the swelling of the river Jordan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when he had concluded his address, he said, &ldquo;Let us
sing a hymn, one composed by Master Charles Wesley&mdash;he was
my countryman, brethren.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Jesus, I cast my soul on Thee,<br />
Mighty and merciful to save;<br />
Thou shalt to death go down with me,<br />
And lay me gently in the grave.<br />
This body then shall rest in hope,<br />
This body which the worms destroy;<br />
For Thou shalt surely raise me up,<br />
To glorious life and endless joy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farewell, preacher with the plain coat, and the calm serious
look!&nbsp; I saw thee once again, and that was lately&mdash;only
the other day.&nbsp; It was near a fishing hamlet, by the
seaside, that I saw the preacher again.&nbsp; He stood on the top
of a steep monticle, used by pilots as a look-out for vessels
approaching that coast, a dangerous one, abounding in rocks and
quicksands.&nbsp; There he stood on the monticle, preaching to
weather-worn fishermen and mariners gathered below upon the
sand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; said I to an old fisherman
who stood beside me with a book of hymns in his hand; but the old
man put his hand to his lips, and that was <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>the only
answer I received.&nbsp; Not a sound was heard but the voice of
the preacher and the roaring of the waves; but the voice was
heard loud above the roaring of the sea, for the preacher now
spoke with power, and his voice was not that of one who
hesitates.&nbsp; There he stood&mdash;no longer a young man, for
his black locks were become grey, even like my own; but there was
the intelligent face, and the calm serious look which had struck
me of yore.&nbsp; There stood the preacher, one of those
men&mdash;and, thank God, their number is not few&mdash;who,
animated by the spirit of Christ, amidst much poverty, and, alas!
much contempt, persist in carrying the light of the Gospel amidst
the dark parishes of what, but for their instrumentality, would
scarcely be Christian England.&nbsp; I would have waited till he
had concluded, in order that I might speak to him, and endeavour
to bring back the ancient scene to his recollection, but suddenly
a man came hurrying towards the monticle, mounted on a speedy
horse, and holding by the bridle one yet more speedy, and he
whispered to me, &ldquo;Why loiterest thou here?&mdash;knowest
thou not all that is to be done before midnight?&rdquo; and he
flung me the bridle; and I mounted on the horse of great speed,
and I followed the other, who had already galloped off.&nbsp; And
as I departed, I waved my hand to him on the monticle, and I
shouted, &ldquo;Farewell, brother! the seed came up at last,
after a long period!&rdquo; and then I gave the speedy horse his
way, and leaning over the shoulder of the galloping horse, I
said, &ldquo;Would that my life had been like his&mdash;even like
that man&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now wandered along the heath, till I came to <!-- page
239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>a
place where, beside a thick furze, sat a man, his eyes fixed
intently on the red ball of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not you, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen you for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should you, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the tents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the old spot, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news since we parted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two deaths, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are dead, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and mother, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where they were sent, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Herne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s alive, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Yorkshire, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your opinion of death, Mr. Petulengro?&rdquo;
said I, as I sat down beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion of death, brother, is much the same as that
in the old song of Pharaoh, which I have heard my grandam
sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Cana marel o manus chivios and&eacute;

<p>When a man dies, he is cast into the earth, and his wife and
child sorrow over him.&nbsp; If he has neither wife nor child,
then his father and mother, I suppose; and if he is quite alone
in the world, <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>why, then, he is cast into the
earth, and there is an end of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think that is the end of a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an end of him, brother, more&rsquo;s the
pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is sweet, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so!&mdash;There&rsquo;s night and day, brother,
both sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother, all sweet
things; there&rsquo;s likewise a wind on the heath.&nbsp; Life is
very sweet, brother; who would wish to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would wish to die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a Gorgio&mdash;which is the same as
talking like a fool&mdash;were you a Rommany Chal you would talk
wiser.&nbsp; Wish to die, indeed!&mdash;A Rommany Chal would wish
to live for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In sickness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the sun and stars, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In blindness, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the wind on the heath, brother; if I
could only feel that, I would gladly live for ever.&nbsp; Dosta,
<a name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"

put on the gloves; and I&rsquo;ll try to make you feel what a
sweet thing it is to be alive, brother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Flower of the Grass&mdash;Days of Pugilism&mdash;The
Rendezvous&mdash;Jews&mdash;Bruisers of England&mdash;Winter,
Spring&mdash;Well-earned Bays&mdash;The Fight&mdash;Huge Black
Cloud&mdash;Frame of Adamant&mdash;The

Gushes.</p>
<p>How for everything there is a time and a season, and then how
does the glory of a thing pass from it, even like the flower of
the grass.&nbsp; This is a truism, but it is one of those which
are continually forcing themselves upon the mind.&nbsp; Many
years have not passed over my head, yet, during those which I can
recall to remembrance, how many things have I seen flourish, pass
away, and become forgotten, except by myself, who, in spite of
all my endeavours, never can forget anything.&nbsp; I have known
the time when a pugilistic encounter between two noted champions
was almost considered in the light of a national affair; when
tens of thousands of individuals, high and low, meditated and
brooded upon it, the first thing in the morning and the last at
night, until the great event was decided.&nbsp; But the time is
past, and many people will say, thank God that it is; all I have
to say is, that the French still live on the other side of the
water, and are still casting their <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>eyes
hitherward&mdash;and that in the days of pugilism it was no vain
boast to say, that one Englishman was a match for two of
t&rsquo;other race; at present it would be a vain boast to say
so, for these are not the days of pugilism.</p>
<p>But those to which the course of my narrative has carried me
were the days of pugilism; it was then at its height, and
consequently near its decline, for corruption had crept into the
ring; and how many things, states and sects among the rest, owe
their decline to this cause!&nbsp; But what a bold and vigorous
aspect pugilism wore at that time! and the great battle was just
then coming off: the day had been decided upon, and the
spot&mdash;a convenient distance from the old town; and to the
old town were now flocking the bruisers of England, men of
tremendous renown.&nbsp; Let no one sneer at the bruisers of
England&mdash;what were the gladiators of Rome, or the
bull-fighters of Spain, in its palmiest days, compared to
England&rsquo;s bruisers?&nbsp; Pity that ever corruption should
have crept in amongst them&mdash;but of that I wish not to talk;
let us still hope that a spark of the old religion, of which they
were the priests, still lingers in the breasts of
Englishmen.&nbsp; There they come, the bruisers, from far London,
or from wherever else they might chance to be at the time, to the
great rendezvous in the old city; some came one way, some
another: some of tip-top reputation came with peers in their
chariots, for glory and fame are such fair things, that even
peers are proud to have those invested therewith by their sides;
others came in their own gigs, driving their own bits of blood,
and I heard one say: &ldquo;I have driven through at a heat the
whole hundred and eleven miles, and only stopped <!-- page
243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>to
bait twice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, the blood-horses of old England! but
they, too, have had their day&mdash;for everything beneath the
sun there is a season and a time.&nbsp; But the greater number
come just as they can contrive; on the tops of coaches, for
example; and amongst these there are fellows with dark sallow
faces, and sharp shining eyes; and it is these that have planted
rottenness in the core of pugilism, for they are Jews, and, true
to their kind, have only base lucre in view.</p>
<p>It was fierce old Cobbett, I think, who first said that the
Jews first introduced bad faith amongst pugilists.&nbsp; He did
not always speak the truth, but at any rate he spoke it when he
made that observation.&nbsp; Strange people the
Jews&mdash;endowed with every gift but one, and that the highest,
genius divine&mdash;genius which can alone make of men demigods,
and elevate them above earth and what is earthy and grovelling;
without which a clever nation&mdash;and who more clever than the
Jews?&mdash;may have Rambams in plenty, but never a Fielding nor
a Shakespeare.&nbsp; A Rothschild and a Mendoza, yes&mdash;but
never a Kean nor a Belcher.</p>
<p>So the bruisers of England are come to be present at the grand
fight speedily coming off; there they are met in the precincts of
the old town, near the field of the chapel, planted with tender
saplings at the restoration of sporting Charles, which are now
become venerable elms, as high as many a steeple; there they are
met at a fitting rendezvous, where a retired coachman, with one
leg, keeps an hotel and a bowling-green.&nbsp; I think I now see
them upon the bowling-green, the men of renown, amidst hundreds
of people with no renown at all, who gaze upon them with timid
<!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>wonder.&nbsp; Fame, after all, is a glorious thing,
though it lasts only for a day.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Cribb, the
champion of England, and perhaps the best man in England; there
he is, with his huge massive figure, and face wonderfully like
that of a lion.&nbsp; There is Belcher, the younger, not the
mighty one, who is gone to his place, but the Teucer Belcher, the
most scientific pugilist that ever entered a ring, only wanting
strength to be, I won&rsquo;t say what.&nbsp; He appears to walk
before me now, as he did that evening, with his white hat, white
great-coat, thin genteel figure, springy step, and keen,
determined eye.&nbsp; Crosses him, what a contrast! grim, savage
Shelton, who has a civil word for nobody, and a hard blow for
anybody&mdash;hard! one blow, given with the proper play of his
athletic arm, will unsense a giant.&nbsp; Yonder individual, who
strolls about with his hands behind him, supporting his brown
coat lappets, under-sized, and who looks anything but what he is,
is the king of the light weights, so called&mdash;Randall! the
terrible Randall, who has Irish blood in his veins; not the
better for that, nor the worse; and not far from him is his last
antagonist, Ned Turner, who, though beaten by him, still thinks
himself as good a man, in which he is, perhaps, right, for it was
a near thing; and &ldquo;a better shentleman,&rdquo; in which he
is quite right, for he is a Welshman.&nbsp; But how shall I name
them all? they were there by dozens, and all tremendous in their
way.&nbsp; There was Bulldog Hudson, and fearless Scroggins, who
beat the conqueror of Sam the Jew.&nbsp; There was Black
Richmond&mdash;no, he was not there, but I knew him well; he was
the most dangerous of blacks, even with a broken thigh.&nbsp;
There was Purcell, who <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>could never
conquer till all seemed over with him.&nbsp; There
was&mdash;what! shall I name thee last? ay, why not?&nbsp; I
believe that thou art the last of all that strong family still
above the sod, where mayst thou long continue&mdash;true piece of
English stuff, Tom of Bedford&mdash;sharp as Winter, kind as
Spring.</p>
<p>Hail to thee, Tom of Bedford, or by whatever name it may
please thee to be called, Spring or Winter.&nbsp; Hail to thee,
six-foot Englishman of the brown eye, worthy to have carried a
six-foot bow at Flodden, where England&rsquo;s yeomen triumphed
over Scotland&rsquo;s king, his clans and chivalry.&nbsp; Hail to
thee, last of England&rsquo;s bruisers, after all the many
victories which thou hast achieved&mdash;true English victories,
unbought by yellow gold; need I recount them? nay, nay! they are
already well known to fame&mdash;sufficient to say that
Bristol&rsquo;s Bull and Ireland&rsquo;s Champion were vanquished
by thee, and one mightier still, gold itself, thou didst
overcome; for gold itself strove in vain to deaden the power of
thy arm; and thus thou didst proceed till men left off
challenging thee, the unvanquishable, the incorruptible.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a treat to see thee, Tom of Bedford, in thy
&ldquo;public&rdquo; in Holborn way, whither thou hast retired
with thy well-earned bays.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Friday night, and
nine by Holborn clock.&nbsp; There sits the yeoman at the end of
his long room, surrounded by his friends; glasses are filled, and
a song is the cry, and a song is sung well suited to the place;
it finds an echo in every heart&mdash;fists are clenched, arms
are waved, and the portraits of the mighty fighting men of yore,
Broughton, and Slack, and Ben, which adorn the walls, appear to
smile grim approbation, <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>whilst many
a manly voice joins in the bold chorus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a health to old honest John
Bull,<br />
When he&rsquo;s gone we shan&rsquo;t find such another,<br />
And with hearts and with glasses brim full,<br />
We will drink to old England, his mother.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the fight! with respect to the fight, what shall I
say?&nbsp; Little can be said about it&mdash;it was soon over;
some said that the brave from town, who was reputed the best man
of the two, and whose form was a perfect model of athletic
beauty, allowed himself, for lucre vile, to be vanquished by the
massive champion with the flattened nose.&nbsp; One thing is
certain, that the former was suddenly seen to sink to the earth
before a blow of by no means extraordinary power.&nbsp; Time,
time! was called; but there he lay upon the ground apparently
senseless, and from thence he did not lift his head till several
seconds after the umpires had declared his adversary victor.</p>
<p>There were shouts; indeed there&rsquo;s never a lack of shouts
to celebrate a victory, however acquired; but there was also much
grinding of teeth, especially amongst the fighting men from
town.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom has sold us,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;sold
us to the yokels; who would have thought it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
there was fresh grinding of teeth, and scowling brows were turned
to the heaven; but what is this? is it possible, does the heaven
scowl too? why, only a quarter of an hour ago . . . but what may
not happen in a quarter of an hour?&nbsp; For many weeks the
weather had been of the most glorious description, the eventful
day, too, had dawned gloriously, and so it had continued till
some two hours after noon; <!-- page 247--><a

was then over; and about that time I looked up&mdash;what a
glorious sky of deep blue, and what a big fierce sun swimming
high above in the midst of that blue; not a cloud&mdash;there had
not been one for weeks&mdash;not a cloud to be seen, only in the
far west, just on the horizon, something like the extremity of a
black wing; that was only a quarter of an hour ago, and now the
whole northern side of the heaven is occupied by a huge black
cloud, and the sun is only occasionally seen amidst masses of
driving vapour; what a change! but another fight is at hand, and
the pugilists are clearing the outer ring;&mdash;how their huge
whips come crashing upon the heads of the yokels; blood flows,
more blood than in the fight; those blows are given with right
good-will, those are not sham blows, whether of whip or fist; it
is with fist that grim Shelton strikes down the big yokel; he is
always dangerous, grim Shelton, but now particularly so, for he
has lost ten pounds betted on the brave who sold himself to the
yokels; but the outer ring is cleared: and now the second fight
commences; it is between two champions of less renown than the
others, but is perhaps not the worse on that account.&nbsp; A
tall thin boy is fighting in the ring with a man somewhat under
the middle size, with a frame of adamant; that&rsquo;s a gallant
boy! he&rsquo;s a yokel, but he comes from Brummagem, and he does
credit to his extraction; but his adversary has a frame of
adamant: in what a strange light they fight, but who can wonder,
on looking at that frightful cloud usurping now one-half of
heaven, and at the sun struggling with sulphurous vapour; the
face of the boy, which is turned towards me, looks horrible in
that light, but he is <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>a brave boy, he strikes his foe on
the forehead, and the report of the blow is like the sound of a
hammer against a rock; but there is a rush and a roar overhead, a
wild commotion, the tempest is beginning to break loose;
there&rsquo;s wind and dust, a crash, rain and hail; is it
possible to fight amidst such a commotion? yes! the fight goes
on; again the boy strikes the man full on the brow, but it is of
no use striking that man, his frame is of adamant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Boy, thy strength is beginning to give way, and thou art
becoming confused;&rdquo; the man now goes to work, amidst rain
and hail.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boy, thou wilt not hold out ten minutes
longer against rain, hail, and the blows of such an
antagonist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the storm was at its height; the black thunder-cloud
had broken into many, which assumed the wildest shapes and the
strangest colours, some of them unspeakably glorious; the rain
poured in a deluge, and more than one waterspout was seen at no
great distance: an immense rabble is hurrying in one direction; a
multitude of men of all ranks, peers and yokels, prize-fighters
and Jews, and the last came to plunder, and are now plundering
amidst that wild confusion of hail and rain, men and horses,
carts and carriages.&nbsp; But all hurry in one direction,
through mud and mire; there&rsquo;s a town only three miles
distant, which is soon reached, and soon filled, it will not
contain one-third of that mighty rabble; but there&rsquo;s
another town farther on&mdash;the good old city is farther on,
only twelve miles; what&rsquo;s that! who will stay here? onward
to the old town.</p>
<p>Hurry-skurry, a mixed multitude of men and horses, carts and
carriages, all in the direction of the old town; and, in the
midst of all that mad <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>throng, at a moment when the rain
gushes were coming down with particular fury, and the artillery
of the sky was pealing as I had never heard it peal before, I
felt some one seize me by the arm&mdash;I turned round, and
beheld Mr. Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you, Mr. Petulengro,&rdquo; said I;
for the thunder drowned the words which he appeared to be
uttering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearginni,&rdquo; I heard Mr. Petulengro say, &ldquo;it
thundereth.&nbsp; I was asking, brother, whether you believe in
dukkeripens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, Mr. Petulengro; but this is strange weather
to be asking me whether I believe in fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grondinni,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;it
haileth.&nbsp; I believe in dukkeripens, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who has more right,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;seeing
that you live by them?&nbsp; But this tempest is truly
horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearginni, grondinni ta villaminni! <a
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a>&nbsp; It thundereth, it haileth, and
also flameth,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look up
there, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up.&nbsp; Connected with this tempest there was one
feature to which I have already alluded&mdash;the wonderful
colours of the clouds.&nbsp; Some were of vivid green; others of
the brightest orange; others as black as pitch.&nbsp; The
Gypsy&rsquo;s finger was pointed to a particular part of the
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see there, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange kind of cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it look like, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like a stream of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&ldquo;That cloud foreshoweth a bloody
dukkeripen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bloody fortune!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;And whom
may it betide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows!&rdquo; said the Gypsy.</p>
<p>Down the way, dashing and splashing, and scattering man,
horse, and cart to the left and right, came an open barouche,
drawn by four smoking steeds, with postillions in scarlet jackets
and leather skull-caps.&nbsp; Two forms were conspicuous in it;
that of the successful bruiser, and of his friend and backer, the
sporting gentleman of my acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His!&rdquo; said the Gypsy, pointing to the latter,
whose stern features wore a smile of triumph, as, probably
recognising me in the crowd, he nodded in the direction of where
I stood, as the barouche hurried by.</p>
<p>There went the barouche, dashing through the rain gushes, and
in it one whose boast it was that he was equal to &ldquo;either
fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many have heard of that man&mdash;many may
be desirous of knowing yet more of him.&nbsp; I have nothing to
do with that man&rsquo;s after life&mdash;he fulfilled his
dukkeripen.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bad, violent man!&rdquo;&nbsp; Softly,
friend; when thou wouldst speak harshly of the dead, remember
that thou hast not yet fulfilled thy own dukkeripen!</p>

<p>My Father&mdash;Premature Decay&mdash;The Easy Chair&mdash;A
Few Questions&mdash;So You Told Me&mdash;A Difficult
Language&mdash;They Call it Haik&mdash;Misused
Opportunities&mdash;Saul&mdash;Want of Candour&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
Weep&mdash;Heaven Forgive Me&mdash;Dated from Paris&mdash;I Wish
He were Here&mdash;A Father&rsquo;s Reminiscences&mdash;Farewell
to Vanities.</p>
<p>My father, as I have already informed the reader, had been
endowed by nature with great corporeal strength; indeed, I have
been assured that, at the period of his prime, his figure had
denoted the possession of almost Herculean powers.&nbsp; The
strongest forms, however, do not always endure the longest, the
very excess of the noble and generous juices which they contain
being the cause of their premature decay.&nbsp; But, be that as
it may, the health of my father, some few years after his
retirement from the service to the quiet of domestic life,
underwent a considerable change; his constitution appeared to be
breaking up; and he was subject to severe attacks from various
disorders, with which, till then, he had been utterly
unacquainted.&nbsp; He was, however, wont to rally, more or less,
after his illnesses, and might still occasionally be seen taking
his walk, with his cane in his hand, and accompanied by his dog,
who <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>sympathised entirely with him,
pining as he pined, improving as he improved, and never leaving
the house save in his company; and in this manner matters went on
for a considerable time, no very great apprehension with respect
to my father&rsquo;s state being raised either in my
mother&rsquo;s breast or my own.&nbsp; But, about six months
after the period at which I have arrived in my last chapter, it
came to pass that my father experienced a severer attack than on
any previous occasion.</p>
<p>He had the best medical advice; but it was easy to see, from
the looks of his doctors, that they entertained but slight hopes
of his recovery.&nbsp; His sufferings were great, yet he
invariably bore them with unshaken fortitude.&nbsp; There was one
thing remarkable connected with his illness; notwithstanding its
severity, it never confined him to his bed.&nbsp; He was wont to
sit in his little parlour, in his easy chair, dressed in a faded
regimental coat, his dog at his feet, who would occasionally lift
his head from the hearth-rug on which he lay, and look his master
wistfully in the face.&nbsp; And thus my father spent the greater
part of his time, sometimes in prayer, sometimes in meditation,
and sometimes in reading the Scriptures.&nbsp; I frequently sat
with him, though, as I entertained a great awe for my father, I
used to feel rather ill at ease, when, as sometimes happened, I
found myself alone with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to ask you a few questions,&rdquo; said he to
me, one day, after my mother had left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer anything you may please to ask me, my
dear father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been about lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>&ldquo;I have been occupied as usual, attending at the
office at the appointed hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I am ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! sometimes I read a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connected with your profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always; I have been lately reading
Armenian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language of a people whose country is a region on
the other side of Asia Minor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A region abounding with mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst which is Mount Ararat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon which, as the Bible informs us, the ark
rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the language of the people of those
regions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have been reading the Bible in their
language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or rather, I should say, in the ancient language of
these people; from which I am told the modern Armenian differs
considerably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as the Italian from the Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have been reading the Bible in ancient
Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me so before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it a highly difficult language.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Differing widely from the languages in general with
which I am acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exhibiting, however, some features in common with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sometimes agreeing remarkably in words with a
certain strange wild speech with which I became
acquainted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, not Irish&mdash;with which I became
acquainted by the greatest chance in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of which I need say nothing farther at present, and
which I should not have mentioned but for that fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I consider remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Armenian is copious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With an alphabet of thirty-nine letters, but it is
harsh and guttural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the language of most mountainous people&mdash;the
Armenians call it Haik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And themselves, Haik, also; they are a remarkable
people, and, though their original habitation is the Mountain of
Ararat, they are to be found, like the Jews, all over the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, father, that&rsquo;s all I can tell you about the
Haiks, or Armenians.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>&ldquo;And what does it all amount to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, father; indeed, there is very little known
about the Armenians; their early history, in particular, is
involved in considerable mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, if you knew all that it was possible to know about
them, to what would it amount? to what earthly purpose could you
turn it? have you acquired any knowledge of your
profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little!&nbsp; Have you acquired all in your
power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I have, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it was your duty to have done so.&nbsp; But I
see how it is, you have shamefully misused your opportunities;
you are like one, who, sent into the field to labour, passes his
time in flinging stones at the birds of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would scorn to fling a stone at a bird,
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean, and all too well, and this
attempt to evade deserved reproof by feigned simplicity is quite
in character with your general behaviour.&nbsp; I have ever
observed about you a want of frankness, which has distressed me;
you never speak of what you are about, your hopes, or your
projects, but cover yourself with mystery.&nbsp; I never knew
till the present moment that you were acquainted with
Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you never asked me, father; there&rsquo;s
nothing to conceal in the matter&mdash;I will tell you in a
moment how I came to learn Armenian.&nbsp; A lady whom I met at
one of Mrs. ---&rsquo;s parties took a fancy to me, and has done
me the honour to allow me to go and see her sometimes.&nbsp; She
is the widow of a rich clergyman, and on her husband&rsquo;s
death <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>came to this place to live, bringing
her husband&rsquo;s library with her: I soon found my way to it,
and examined every book.&nbsp; Her husband must have been a
learned man, for amongst much Greek and Hebrew I found several
volumes in Armenian, or relating to the language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you not tell me of this before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you never questioned me; but I repeat, there is
nothing to conceal in the matter.&nbsp; The lady took a fancy to
me, and, being fond of the arts, drew my portrait; she said the
expression of my countenance put her in mind of Alfieri&rsquo;s
Saul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you still visit her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she soon grew tired of me, and told people that she
found me very stupid; she gave me the Armenian books,
however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saul,&rdquo; said my father, musingly, &ldquo;Saul; I
am afraid she was only too right there; he disobeyed the commands
of his master, and brought down on his head the vengeance of
Heaven&mdash;he became a maniac, prophesied, and flung weapons
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, indeed, an awful character&mdash;I hope I
shan&rsquo;t turn out like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said my father, solemnly; &ldquo;but
in many respects you are headstrong and disobedient like
him.&nbsp; I placed you in a profession, and besought you to make
yourself master of it, by giving it your undivided
attention.&nbsp; This, however, you did not do; you know nothing
of it, but tell me that you are acquainted with Armenian; but
what I dislike most is your want of candour&mdash;you are my son,
but I know little of your real history; you may know fifty things
for what I am aware: you may know how to shoe a horse for what I
am aware.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>&ldquo;Not only to shoe a horse, father, but to make
horse-shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;and it only
serves to prove what I was just saying, that I know little about
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you easily may, my dear father; I will tell you
anything that you may wish to know&mdash;shall I inform you how I
learnt to make horse-shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said my father; &ldquo;as you kept it a
secret so long, it may as well continue so still.&nbsp; Had you
been a frank, open-hearted boy, like one I could name, you would
have told me all about it of your own accord.&nbsp; But I now
wish to ask you a serious question&mdash;what do you propose to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! the time for which you were articled to your
profession will soon be expired, and I shall be no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not talk so, my dear father; I have no doubt that
you will soon be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not flatter yourself; I feel that my days are
numbered; I am soon going to my rest, and I have need of rest,
for I am weary.&nbsp; There, there, don&rsquo;t weep!&nbsp; Tears
will help me as little as they will you; you have not yet
answered my question.&nbsp; Tell me what you intend to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really do not know what I shall do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The military pension which I enjoy will cease with my
life.&nbsp; The property which I shall leave behind me will be
barely sufficient for the maintenance of your mother
respectably.&nbsp; I again ask you what you intend to do.&nbsp;
Do you think you can support yourself by your Armenian or your
other acquirements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I think little at all about it; but I <!--
page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>suppose I must push into the world, and make a good
fight, as becomes the son of him who fought Big Ben; if I
can&rsquo;t succeed, and am driven to the worst, it is but
dying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving the world; my loss would scarcely be
felt.&nbsp; I have never held life in much value, and every one
has a right to dispose as he thinks best of that which is his
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! now I understand you; and well I know how and where
you imbibed that horrible doctrine, and many similar ones which I
have heard from your mouth; but I wish not to reproach
you&mdash;I view in your conduct a punishment for my own sins,
and I bow to the will of God.&nbsp; Few and evil have been my
days upon the earth; little have I done to which I can look back
with satisfaction.&nbsp; It is true I have served my king fifty
years, and I have fought with&mdash;Heaven forgive me, what was I
about to say!&mdash;but you mentioned the man&rsquo;s name, and
our minds willingly recall our ancient follies.&nbsp; Few and
evil have been my days upon earth, I may say with Jacob of old,
though I do not mean to say that my case is so hard as his; he
had many undutiful children, whilst I have only . . .; but I will
not reproach you.&nbsp; I have also like him a son to whom I can
look with hope, who may yet preserve my name when I am gone, so
let me be thankful; perhaps, after all, I have not lived in
vain.&nbsp; Boy, when I am gone, look up to your brother, and may
God bless you both.&nbsp; There, don&rsquo;t weep; but take the
Bible, and read me something about the old man and his
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My brother had now been absent for the space of three
years.&nbsp; At first his letters had been frequent, <!-- page
259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>and from them it appeared that he was following his
profession in London with industry; they then became rather rare,
and my father did not always communicate their contents.&nbsp;
His last letter, however, had filled him and our whole little
family with joy; it was dated from Paris, and the writer was
evidently in high spirits.&nbsp; After describing in eloquent
terms the beauties and gaieties of the French capital, he
informed us how he had plenty of money, having copied a
celebrated picture of one of the Italian masters for a Hungarian
nobleman, for which he had received a large sum.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
wishes me to go with him to Italy,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;but I
am fond of independence; and, if ever I visit old Rome, I will
have no patrons near me to distract my attention.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But six months had now elapsed from the date of this letter, and
we had heard no farther intelligence of my brother.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s complaint increased; the gout, his principal
enemy, occasionally mounted high up in his system, and we had
considerable difficulty in keeping it from the stomach, where it
generally proves fatal.&nbsp; I now devoted almost the whole of
my time to my father, on whom his faithful partner also lavished
every attention and care.&nbsp; I read the Bible to him, which
was his chief delight; and also occasionally such other books as
I thought might prove entertaining to him.&nbsp; His spirits were
generally rather depressed.&nbsp; The absence of my brother
appeared to prey upon his mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish he were
here,&rdquo; he would frequently exclaim; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine what can have become of him; I trust, however, he will
arrive in time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He still sometimes rallied, and I
took advantage of those moments of comparative ease, to question
him upon the events of his early <!-- page 260--><a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>life.&nbsp;
My attentions to him had not passed unnoticed, and he was kind,
fatherly, and unreserved.&nbsp; I had never known my father so
entertaining as at these moments, when his life was but too
evidently drawing to a close.&nbsp; I had no idea that he knew
and had seen so much; my respect for him increased, and I looked
upon him almost with admiration.&nbsp; His anecdotes were in
general highly curious; some of them related to people in the
highest stations, and to men whose names were closely connected
with some of the brightest glories of our native land.&nbsp; He
had frequently conversed&mdash;almost on terms of
familiarity&mdash;with good old George.&nbsp; He had known the
conqueror of Tippoo Saib; and was the friend of Townshend, who,
when Wolfe fell, led the British grenadiers against the shrinking
regiments of Montcalm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;that when old&mdash;old as I am now&mdash;he should have
driven his own son mad by robbing him of his plighted bride; but
so it was; he married his son&rsquo;s bride.&nbsp; I saw him lead
her to the altar; if ever there was an angelic countenance, it
was that girl&rsquo;s; she was almost too fair to be one of the
daughters of women.&nbsp; Is there anything, boy, that you would
wish to ask me? now is the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father; there is one about whom I would fain
question you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it? shall I tell you about Elliot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, not about Elliot; but pray don&rsquo;t be
angry; I should like to know something about Big Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a strange lad,&rdquo; said my father;
&ldquo;and, though of late I have begun to entertain a more
favourable opinion than heretofore, there is still <!-- page
261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>much about you that I do not understand.&nbsp; Why do
you bring up that name?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know that it is one
of my temptations? you wish to know something about him.&nbsp;
Well!&nbsp; I will oblige you this once, and then farewell to
such vanities&mdash;something about him.&nbsp; I will tell
you&mdash;his skin, when he flung off his clothes&mdash;and he
had a particular knack in doing so&mdash;his skin, when he bared
his mighty chest and back for combat&mdash;and when he fought he
stood so . . . if I remember right&mdash;his skin, I say, was
brown and dusky as that of a toad.&nbsp; Oh me!&nbsp; I wish my
elder son was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My Brother&rsquo;s Arrival&mdash;The
Interview&mdash;Night&mdash;A Dying Father&mdash;Christ.</p>
<p>At last my brother arrived; he looked pale and unwell; I met
him at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have been long absent,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps too long; but how
is my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poorly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he has had a fresh
attack; but where have you been of late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far and wide,&rdquo; said my brother; &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t tell you anything now, I must go to my father.&nbsp;
It was only by chance that I heard of his illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay a moment,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the world
such a fine place as you supposed it to be before you went
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said my brother, &ldquo;not quite;
indeed I wish&mdash;but ask me no questions now, I must hasten to
my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another question on my tongue, but I forbore; for
the eyes of the young man were full of tears.&nbsp; I pointed
with my finger, and the young man hastened past me to the arms of
his father.</p>
<p>I forbore to ask my brother whether he had been to old
Rome.</p>
<p>What passed between my father and brother I <!-- page 263--><a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>do not
know; the interview, no doubt, was tender enough, for they
tenderly loved each other; but my brother&rsquo;s arrival did not
produce the beneficial effect upon my father which I at first
hoped it would; it did not even appear to have raised his
spirits.&nbsp; He was composed enough, however: &ldquo;I ought to
be grateful,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I wished to see my son, and
God has granted me my wish; what more have I to do now than to
bless my little family and go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s end was evidently at hand.</p>
<p>And did I shed no tears? did I breathe no sighs? did I never
wring my hands at this period? the reader will perhaps be
asking.&nbsp; Whatever I did and thought is best known to God and
myself; but it will be as well to observe, that it is possible to
feel deeply, and yet make no outward sign.</p>
<p>And now for the closing scene.</p>
<p>At the dead hour of night, it might be about two, I was
awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from the room
immediately below that in which I slept.&nbsp; I knew the cry, it
was the cry of my mother; and I also knew its import, yet I made
no effort to rise, for I was for the moment paralysed.&nbsp;
Again the cry sounded, yet still I lay motionless&mdash;the
stupidity of horror was upon me.&nbsp; A third time, and it was
then that, by a violent effort, bursting the spell which appeared
to bind me, I sprang from the bed and rushed downstairs.&nbsp; My
mother was running wildly about the room; she had awoke, and
found my father senseless in the bed by her side.&nbsp; I essayed
to raise him, and after a few efforts supported him in the bed in
a sitting posture.&nbsp; My brother now rushed in, and, snatching
up a light that was burning, he held it to my <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>father&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The surgeon, the
surgeon!&rdquo; he cried; then, dropping the light, he ran out of
the room followed by my mother; I remained alone, supporting the
senseless form of my father; the light had been extinguished by
the fall, and an almost total darkness reigned in the room.&nbsp;
The form pressed heavily against my bosom&mdash;at last methought
it moved.&nbsp; Yes, I was right, there was a heaving of the
breast, and then a gasping.&nbsp; Were those words which I
heard?&nbsp; Yes, they were words, low and indistinct at first,
and then audible.&nbsp; The mind of the dying man was reverting
to former scenes.&nbsp; I heard him mention names which I had
often heard him mention before.&nbsp; It was an awful moment; I
felt stupefied, but I still contrived to support my dying
father.&nbsp; There was a pause, again my father spoke: I heard
him speak of Minden, <a name="citation264"></a><a
href="#footnote264" class="citation">[264]</a> and of Meredith,
the old Minden sergeant, and then he uttered another name, which
at one period of his life was much in his lips, the name of . . .
but this is a solemn moment!&nbsp; There was a deep gasp: I
shook, and thought all was over; but I was mistaken&mdash;my
father moved, and revived for a moment; he supported himself in
bed without my assistance.&nbsp; I make no doubt that for a
moment he was perfectly sensible, and it was then that, clasping
his hands, he uttered another name clearly, distinctly&mdash;it
was the name of Christ.&nbsp; With that name upon his lips, the
brave old soldier sank back upon my bosom, and, with his hands
still clasped, yielded up his soul.</p>

<p>The Greeting&mdash;Queer Figure&mdash;Cheer Up&mdash;The
Cheerful Fire&mdash;It Will Do&mdash;The Sally
Forth&mdash;Trepidation&mdash;Let Him Come In.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-and-Ninepence, sir, or the things which you have
brought with you will be taken away from you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the first words which greeted my ears, one damp
misty morning in March, <a name="citation265"></a><a
href="#footnote265" class="citation">[265]</a> as I dismounted
from the top of a coach in the yard of a London inn.</p>
<p>I turned round, for I felt that the words were addressed to
myself.&nbsp; Plenty of people were in the yard&mdash;porters,
passengers, coachmen, ostlers, and others, who appeared to be
intent on anything but myself, with the exception of one
individual, whose business appeared to lie with me, and who now
confronted me at the distance of about two yards.</p>
<p>I looked hard at the man&mdash;and a queer kind of individual
he was to look at&mdash;a rakish figure, about thirty, and of the
middle size, dressed in a coat smartly cut, but threadbare, very
tight pantaloons of blue stuff, tied at the ankles, dirty white
stockings and thin shoes, like those of a dancing-master; <!--
page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>his features were not ugly, but rather haggard, and he
appeared to owe his complexion less to nature than carmine; in
fact, in every respect, a very queer figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-and-ninepence, sir, or your things will be taken
away from you!&rdquo; he said, in a kind of lisping tone, coming
yet nearer to me.</p>
<p>I still remained staring fixedly at him, but never a word
answered.&nbsp; Our eyes met; whereupon he suddenly lost the easy
impudent air which he before wore.&nbsp; He glanced, for a
moment, at my fist, which I had by this time clenched, and his
features became yet more haggard; he faltered; a fresh
&ldquo;one-and-ninepence,&rdquo; which he was about to utter,
died on his lips; he shrank back, disappeared behind a coach, and
I saw no more of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-and-ninepence, or my things will be taken away from
me!&rdquo; said I to myself, musingly, as I followed the porter
to whom I had delivered my scanty baggage; &ldquo;am I to expect
many of these greetings in the big world?&nbsp; Well, never
mind!&nbsp; I think I know the counter-sign!&rdquo;&nbsp; And I
clenched my fist yet harder than before.</p>
<p>So I followed the porter, through the streets of London, to a
lodging which had been prepared for me by an acquaintance.&nbsp;
The morning, as I have before said, was gloomy, and the streets
through which I passed were dank and filthy; the people, also,
looked dank and filthy; and so, probably, did I, for the night
had been rainy, and I had come upwards of a hundred miles on the
top of a coach; my heart had sunk within me, by the time we
reached a dark narrow street, in which was the lodging.</p>
<p><!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>&ldquo;Cheer up, young man,&rdquo; said the porter,
&ldquo;we shall have a fine afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And presently I found myself in the lodging which had been
prepared for me.&nbsp; It consisted of a small room, up two pair
of stairs, in which I was to sit, and another still smaller above
it, in which I was to sleep.&nbsp; I remember that I sat down,
and looked, disconsolate, about me&mdash;everything seemed so
cold and dingy.&nbsp; Yet how little is required to make a
situation&mdash;however cheerless at first sight&mdash;cheerful
and comfortable.&nbsp; The people of the house, who looked kindly
upon me, lighted a fire in the dingy grate; and, then, what a
change!&mdash;the dingy room seemed dingy no more!&nbsp; Oh, the
luxury of a cheerful fire after a chill night&rsquo;s
journey!&nbsp; I drew near to the blazing grate, rubbed my hands,
and felt glad.</p>
<p>And, when I had warmed myself, I turned to the table, on
which, by this time, the people of the house had placed my
breakfast; and I ate and I drank; and, as I ate and drank, I
mused within myself, and my eyes were frequently directed to a
small green box, which constituted part of my luggage, and which,
with the rest of my things, stood in one corner of the room, till
at last, leaving my breakfast unfinished, I rose, and, going to
the box, unlocked it, and took out two or three bundles of papers
tied with red tape, and, placing them on the table, I resumed my
seat and my breakfast, my eyes intently fixed upon the bundles of
papers all the time.</p>
<p>And when I had drained the last cup of tea out of a dingy
teapot, and ate the last slice of the dingy loaf, I untied one of
the bundles, and proceeded to look over the papers, which were
<!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>closely written over in a singular hand, and I read for
some time, till at last I said to myself, &ldquo;It will
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then I looked at the other bundle for some
time without untying it; and at last I said, &ldquo;It will do
also.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then I turned to the fire, and, putting my
feet against the sides of the grate, I leaned back on my chair,
and, with my eyes upon the fire, fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>And there I continued in thought before the fire, until my
eyes closed, and I fell asleep; which was not to be wondered at,
after the fatigue and cold which I had lately undergone on the
coach-top; and, in my sleep, I imagined myself still there,
amidst darkness and rain, hurrying now over wild heaths, and now
along roads overhung with thick and umbrageous trees, and
sometimes methought I heard the horn of the guard, and sometimes
the voice of the coachman, now chiding, now encouraging his
horses, as they toiled through the deep and miry ways.&nbsp; At
length a tremendous crack of a whip saluted the tympanum of my
ear, and I started up broad awake, nearly oversetting the chair
on which I reclined&mdash;and, lo! I was in the dingy room before
the fire, which was by this time half extinguished.&nbsp; In my
dream I had confounded the noise of the street with those of my
night-journey; the crack which had aroused me I soon found
proceeded from the whip of a carter, who, with many oaths, was
flogging his team below the window.</p>
<p>Looking at a clock which stood upon the mantelpiece, I
perceived that it was past eleven; whereupon I said to myself,
&ldquo;I am wasting my time foolishly and unprofitably,
forgetting that I am now in the big world, without anything to
depend <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>upon save my own exertions;&rdquo;
and then I adjusted my dress, and, locking up the bundle of
papers which I had not read, I tied up the other, and, taking it
under my arm, I went downstairs; and, after asking a question or
two of the people of the house, I sallied forth into the street
with a determined look, though at heart I felt somewhat timorous
at the idea of venturing out alone into the mazes of the mighty
city, of which I had heard much, but of which, of my own
knowledge, I knew nothing.</p>
<p>I had, however, no great cause for anxiety in the present
instance; I easily found my way to the place which I was in quest
of&mdash;one of the many new squares on the northern side of the
metropolis, and which was scarcely ten minutes&rsquo; walk from
the street in which I had taken up my abode.&nbsp; Arriving
before the door of a tolerably large house which bore a certain
number, I stood still for a moment in a kind of trepidation,
looking anxiously at the door; I then slowly passed on till I
came to the end of the square, where I stood still, and pondered
for a while.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, like one who has formed a
resolution, I clenched my right hand, flinging my hat somewhat on
one side, and, turning back with haste to the door before which I
had stopped, I sprang up the steps, and gave a loud rap, ringing
at the same time the bell of the area.&nbsp; After the lapse of a
minute the door was opened by a maid-servant of no very cleanly
or prepossessing appearance, of whom I demanded, in a tone of
some hauteur, whether the master of the house was at home.&nbsp;
Glancing for a moment at the white paper bundle beneath my arm,
the handmaid made no reply in <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>words, but,
with a kind of toss of her head, flung the door open, standing on
one side as if to let me enter.&nbsp; I did enter; and the
handmaid, having opened another door on the right hand, went in,
and said something which I could not hear: after a considerable
pause, however, I heard the voice of a man say, &ldquo;Let him
come in;&rdquo; whereupon the handmaid, coming out, motioned me
to enter, and, on my obeying, instantly closed the door behind
me.</p>
<h2><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span

<p>The Sinister Glance&mdash;Excellent Correspondent&mdash;Quite
Original&mdash;My System&mdash;A Losing
Trade&mdash;Merit&mdash;Starting a Review&mdash;What Have You
Got?&mdash;Stop!&mdash;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter&mdash;Oxford
Principles&mdash;More Conversation&mdash;How is This?</p>
<p>There were two individuals in the room in which I now found
myself; it was a small study, surrounded with bookcases, the
window looking out upon the square.&nbsp; Of these individuals he
who appeared to be the principal stood with his back to the
fireplace.&nbsp; He was a tall stout man, about sixty, dressed in
a loose morning gown.&nbsp; The expression of his countenance
would have been bluff but for a certain sinister glance, and his
complexion might have been called rubicund but for a considerable
tinge of bilious yellow.&nbsp; He eyed me askance as I
entered.&nbsp; The other, a pale, shrivelled-looking person, sat
at a table apparently engaged with an account-book; he took no
manner of notice of me, never once lifting his eyes from the page
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what is your pleasure!&rdquo; said the big
man, <a name="citation270"></a><a href="#footnote270"
class="citation">[270]</a> in a rough tone, as I stood there,
<!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>looking at him wistfully&mdash;as well I
might&mdash;for upon that man, at the time of which I am
speaking, my principal, I may say my only, hopes rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my name is so-and-so, and I
am the bearer of a letter to you from Mr. so-and-so, an old
friend and correspondent of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of the big man instantly lost the suspicious
and lowering expression which it had hitherto exhibited; he
strode forward, and, seizing me by the hand, gave me a violent
squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am rejoiced to
see you in London.&nbsp; I have been long anxious for the
pleasure&mdash;we are old friends, though we have never before
met.&nbsp; Taggart,&rdquo; said he to the man who sat at the
desk, &ldquo;this is our excellent correspondent, the friend and
pupil of our other excellent correspondent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pale, shrivelled-looking man slowly and deliberately
raised his head from the account-book, and surveyed me for a
moment or two; not the slightest emotion was observable in his
countenance.&nbsp; It appeared to me, however, that I could
detect a droll twinkle in his eye: his curiosity, if he had any,
was soon gratified; he made me a kind of bow, pulled out a
snuff-box, took a pinch of snuff, and again bent his head over
the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the big man,
&ldquo;pray sit down, and tell me the cause of your visit.&nbsp;
I hope you intend to remain here a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am come to take
up my abode in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;Glad to hear it; and what have you been about of
late? got anything which will suit me?&nbsp; Sir, I admire your
style of writing, and your manner of thinking; and I am much
obliged to my good friend and correspondent for sending me some
of your productions.&nbsp; I inserted them all, and wished there
had been more of them&mdash;quite original, sir, quite: took with
the public, especially the essay about the non-existence of
anything.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t exactly agree with you though; I
have my own peculiar ideas about matter&mdash;as you know, of
course, from the book I have published.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a
very pretty piece of speculative philosophy&mdash;no such thing
as matter&mdash;impossible that there should be&mdash;<i>ex
nihilo</i>&mdash;what is the Greek?&nbsp; I have
forgot&mdash;very pretty indeed; very original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, sir, it was very wrong to write such
trash, and yet more to allow it to be published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trash! not at all; a very pretty piece of speculative
philosophy; of course you were wrong in saying there is no
world.&nbsp; The world must exist, to have the shape of a pear;
and that the world is shaped like a pear, and not like an apple,
as the fools of Oxford say, I have satisfactorily proved in my
book.&nbsp; Now, if there were no world, what would become of my
system?&nbsp; But what do you propose to do in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the letter, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of our
good friend, which I have not yet given to you; I believe it will
explain to you the circumstances under which I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the letter, and perused it with attention.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said he, with a somewhat altered manner,
&ldquo;my friend tells me that you are come up to <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>London with the view of turning your literary talents
to account, and desires me to assist you in my capacity of
publisher in bringing forth two or three works which you have
prepared.&nbsp; My good friend is perhaps not aware that for some
time past I have given up publishing&mdash;was obliged to do
so&mdash;had many severe losses&mdash;do nothing at present in
that line, save sending out the Magazine once a month; and,
between ourselves, am thinking of disposing of that&mdash;wish to
retire&mdash;high time at my age&mdash;so you
see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, sir, to hear that you cannot assist
me&rdquo; (and I remember that I felt very nervous); &ldquo;I had
hoped&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A losing trade, I assure you, sir; literature is a
drug.&nbsp; Taggart, what o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir!&rdquo; said I, rising, &ldquo;as you cannot
assist me, I will now take my leave; I thank you sincerely for
your kind reception, and will trouble you no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; I wish to have some farther
conversation with you; and perhaps I may hit upon some plan to
benefit you.&nbsp; I honour merit, and always make a point to
encourage it when I can; but, . . . Taggart, go to the bank, and
tell them to dishonour the bill twelve months after date for
thirty pounds which becomes due to-morrow.&nbsp; I am
dissatisfied with that fellow who wrote the fairy tales, and
intend to give him all the trouble in my power.&nbsp; Make
haste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart did not appear to be in any particular haste.&nbsp;
First of all, he took a pinch of snuff, then, rising from his
chair, slowly and deliberately drew his wig, for he wore a wig of
a brown colour, rather more over his forehead than it had
previously <!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>been, buttoned his coat, and, taking
his hat, and an umbrella which stood in a corner, made me a low
bow, and quitted the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, where were we?&nbsp; Oh, I remember, we were
talking about merit.&nbsp; Sir, I always wish to encourage merit,
especially when it comes so highly recommended as in the present
instance.&nbsp; Sir, my good friend and correspondent speaks of
you in the highest terms.&nbsp; Sir, I honour my good friend, and
have the highest respect for his opinion in all matters connected
with literature&mdash;rather eccentric though.&nbsp; Sir, my good
friend has done my periodical more good and more harm than all
the rest of my correspondents.&nbsp; Sir, I shall never forget
the sensation caused by the appearance of his article about a
certain personage whom he proved&mdash;and I think
satisfactorily&mdash;to have been a legionary
soldier&mdash;rather startling, was it not?&nbsp; The S--- of the
world a common soldier, in a marching regiment&mdash;original,
but startling; sir, I honour my good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have renounced publishing, sir,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;with the exception of the Magazine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; except now and then, under the rose; the old
coachman, you know, likes to hear the whip.&nbsp; Indeed, at the
present moment, I am thinking of starting a Review on an entirely
new and original principle; and it just struck me that you might
be of high utility in the undertaking&mdash;what do you think of
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be happy, sir, to render you any assistance,
but I am afraid the employment you propose requires other
qualifications than I possess; however, I can make the
essay.&nbsp; My chief intention <!-- page 276--><a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>in coming
to London was to lay before the world what I had prepared; and I
had hoped by your assistance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I see, ambition!&nbsp; Ambition is a very
pretty thing; but, sir, we must walk before we run, according to
the old saying&mdash;what is that you have got under your
arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the works to which I was alluding; the one,
indeed, which I am most anxious to lay before the world, as I
hope to derive from it both profit and reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! what do you call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ancient songs of Denmark, heroic and romantic,
translated by myself; with notes philological, critical, and
historical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, I assure you that your time and labour have
been entirely flung away; nobody would read your ballads, if you
were to give them to the world to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, sir, that you would say otherwise if you
would permit me to read one to you;&rdquo; and, without waiting
for the answer of the big man, nor indeed so much as looking at
him, to see whether he was inclined or not to hear me, I undid my
manuscript, and, with a voice trembling with eagerness, I read to
the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Buckshank bold and Elfinstone,<br />
And more than I can mention here,<br />
They caused to be built so stout a ship,<br />
And unto Iceland they would steer.</p>
<p>They launched the ship upon the main,<br />
Which bellowed like a wrathful bear;<br />
Down to the bottom the vessel sank,<br />
A laidly Trold has dragged it there.</p>
<p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>Down to the bottom sank young Roland,<br />
And round about he groped awhile;<br />
Until he found the path which led<br />
Unto the bower of Ellenlyle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said the publisher; &ldquo;very pretty
indeed, and very original; beats Scott hollow, and Percy too:
but, sir, the day for these things is gone by; nobody at present
cares for Percy, nor for Scott, either, save as a novelist; sorry
to discourage merit, sir, but what can I do!&nbsp; What else have
you got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The songs of Ab Gwilym, the Welsh bard, also translated
by myself, with notes critical, philological, and
historical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass on&mdash;what else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing else,&rdquo; said I, folding up my manuscript
with a sigh, &ldquo;unless it be a romance in the German style;
on which, I confess, I set very little value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, very wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the &lsquo;Miller of the Black
Valley&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, very much like the &lsquo;Miller of the Black
Valley.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said the publisher;
&ldquo;and yet, I don&rsquo;t know, I question whether any one at
present cares for the miller himself.&nbsp; No, sir, the time for
those things is also gone by; German, at present, is a drug; and,
between ourselves, nobody has contributed to make it so more than
my good friend and correspondent;&mdash;but, sir, I see you are a
young gentleman of infinite merit, and I always wish to encourage
merit.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think you could write a series of
evangelical tales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evangelical tales, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;Yes, sir, evangelical novels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something in the style of Herder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herder is a drug, sir; nobody cares for
Herder&mdash;thanks to my good friend.&nbsp; Sir, I have in yon
drawer a hundred pages about Herder, which I dare not insert in
my periodical; it would sink it, sir.&nbsp; No, sir, something in
the style of the &lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<a name="citation278"></a><a href="#footnote278"
class="citation">[278]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of the work till the present
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, procure it by all means.&nbsp; Sir, I could
afford as much as ten pounds for a well-written tale in the style
of the &lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;; that is the kind
of literature, sir, that sells at the present day!&nbsp; It is
not the Miller of the Black Valley&mdash;no, sir, nor Herder
either, that will suit the present taste; the evangelical body is
becoming very strong, sir; the canting
scoundrels&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, surely you would not pander to a scoundrelly
taste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, I must give up business altogether.&nbsp;
Sir, I have a great respect for the goddess Reason&mdash;an
infinite respect, sir; indeed, in my time, I have made a great
many sacrifices for her; but, sir, I cannot altogether ruin
myself for the goddess Reason.&nbsp; Sir, I am a friend to
Liberty, as is well known; but I must also be a friend to my own
family.&nbsp; It is with the view of providing for a son of mine
that I am about to start the Review of which <!-- page 279--><a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>I was
speaking.&nbsp; He has taken into his head to marry, sir, and I
must do something for him, for he can do but little for
himself.&nbsp; Well, sir, I am a friend to Liberty, as I said
before, and likewise a friend to Reason; but I tell you frankly
that the Review which I intend to get up under the rose, and
present him with when it is established, will be conducted on
Oxford principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orthodox principles, I suppose you mean,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir; I am no linguist, but I believe the words
are synonymous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much more conversation passed between us, and it was agreed
that I should become a contributor to the &ldquo;Oxford
Review.&rdquo;&nbsp; I stipulated, however, that, as I knew
little of politics, and cared less, no other articles should be
required from me than such as were connected with belles-lettres
and philology; to this the big man readily assented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing will be required from you,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but what you mention; and now and then, perhaps, a paper
on metaphysics.&nbsp; You understand German, and perhaps it would
be desirable that you should review Kant; and in a review of
Kant, sir, you could introduce to advantage your peculiar notions
about <i>ex nihilo</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then reverted to the
subject of the &ldquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; which I
promised to take into consideration.&nbsp; As I was going away,
he invited me to dine with him on the ensuing Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a strange man!&rdquo; said I to myself,
after I had left the house; &ldquo;he is evidently very clever;
but I cannot say that I like him much, with his &lsquo;Oxford
Reviews&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughters.&rsquo;&nbsp; But what can I do?&nbsp; I am almost
without a friend <!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>in the world.&nbsp; I wish I could
find some one who would publish my ballads, or my songs of Ab
Gwilym.&nbsp; In spite of what the big man says, I am convinced
that, once published, they would bring me much fame and
profit.&nbsp; But how is this?&mdash;what a beautiful
sun!&mdash;the porter was right in saying that the day would

manuscripts, and then take a stroll about the big
city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Walk&mdash;London&rsquo;s Cheape&mdash;Street of the
Lombards&mdash;Strange Bridge&mdash;Main Arch&mdash;The Roaring
Gulf&mdash;The Boat&mdash;Clyfaking&mdash;A Comfort&mdash;The
Book&mdash;The Blessed Woman&mdash;No Trap.</p>
<p>So I set out on my walk to see the wonders of the big city,
and, as chance would have it, I directed my course to the
east.&nbsp; The day, as I have already said, had become very
fine, so that I saw the great city to advantage, and the wonders
thereof: and much I admired all I saw; and, amongst other things,
the huge cathedral, standing so proudly on the most commanding
ground in the big city; and I looked up to the mighty dome,
surmounted by a golden cross, and I said within myself,
&ldquo;That dome must needs be the finest in the world;&rdquo;
and I gazed upon it till my eyes reeled, and my brain became
dizzy, and I thought that the dome would fall and crush me; and I
shrank within myself, and struck yet deeper into the heart of the
big city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Cheapside!&nbsp; Cheapside!&rdquo; said I, as I
advanced up that mighty thoroughfare, &ldquo;truly thou art a
wonderful place for hurry, noise, and riches!&nbsp; Men talk of
the bazaars of the East&mdash;I have never seen them&mdash;but I
dare say that, compared with thee, <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>they are
poor places, silent places, abounding with empty boxes, O thou
pride of London&rsquo;s east!&mdash;mighty mart of old
renown!&mdash;for thou art not a place of yesterday:&mdash;long
before the Roses red and white battled in fair England, thou
didst exist&mdash;a place of throng and bustle&mdash;a place of
gold and silver, perfumes and fine linen.&nbsp; Centuries ago
thou couldst extort the praises even of the fiercest foes of
England.&nbsp; Fierce bards of Wales, sworn foes of England, sang
thy praises centuries ago; and even the fiercest of them all, Red
Julius himself, wild Glendower&rsquo;s bard, had a word of praise
for London&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cheape,&rsquo; for so the bards of
Wales styled thee in their flowing odes.&nbsp; Then, if those who
were not English, and hated England, and all connected therewith,
had yet much to say in thy praise, when thou wast far inferior to
what thou art now, why should true-born Englishmen, or those who
call themselves so, turn up their noses at thee, and scoff thee
at the present day, as I believe they do?&nbsp; But, let others
do as they will, I, at least, who am not only an Englishman, but
an East Englishman, will not turn up my nose at thee, but will
praise and extol thee, calling thee mart of the world&mdash;a
place of wonder and astonishment!&mdash;and, were it right and
fitting to wish that anything should endure for ever, I would say
prosperity to Cheapside, throughout all ages&mdash;may it be the
world&rsquo;s resort for merchandise, world without
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when I had passed through the Cheape I entered another
street, which led up a kind of ascent, and which proved to be the
street of the Lombards, called so from the name of its first
founders; and I walked rapidly up the street of the Lombards,
<!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>neither looking to the right nor left, for it had no
interest for me, though I had a kind of consciousness that mighty
things were being transacted behind its walls; but it wanted the
throng, bustle, and outward magnificence of the Cheape, and it
had never been spoken of by &ldquo;ruddy bards&rdquo;!&nbsp; And,
when I had got to the end of the street of the Lombards, I stood
still for some time, deliberating within myself whether I should
turn to the right or the left, or go straight forward, and at
last I turned to the right, down a street of rapid descent, and
presently found myself upon a bridge which traversed the river
which runs by the big city.</p>
<p>A strange kind of bridge it was; huge and massive, and
seemingly of great antiquity.&nbsp; It had an arched back, like
that of a hog, a high balustrade, and at either side, at
intervals, were stone bowers bulking over the river, but open on
the other side, and furnished with a semicircular bench.&nbsp;
Though the bridge was wide&mdash;very wide&mdash;it was all too
narrow for the concourse upon it.&nbsp; Thousands of human beings
were pouring over the bridge.&nbsp; But what chiefly struck my
attention was a double row of carts and wagons, the generality
drawn by horses as large as elephants, each row striving hard in
a different direction, and not unfrequently brought to a
standstill.&nbsp; Oh the cracking of whips, the shouts and oaths
of the carters, and the grating of wheels upon the enormous
stones that formed the pavement!&nbsp; In fact, there was a wild
hurly-burly upon the bridge, which nearly deafened me.&nbsp; But,
if upon the bridge there was a confusion, below it there was a
confusion ten times confounded.&nbsp; The tide, which was fast
<!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>ebbing, obstructed by the immense piers of the old
bridge, poured beneath the arches with a fall of several feet,
forming in the river below as many whirlpools as there were
arches.&nbsp; Truly tremendous was the roar of the descending
waters, and the bellow of the tremendous gulfs, which swallowed
them for a time, and then cast them forth, foaming and frothing
from their horrid wombs.&nbsp; Slowly advancing along the bridge,
I came to the highest point, and there I stood still, close
beside one of the stone bowers, in which, beside a fruit-stall,
sat an old woman, with a pan of charcoal at her feet, and a book
in her hand, in which she appeared to be reading intently.&nbsp;
There I stood, just above the principal arch, looking through the
balustrade at the scene that presented itself&mdash;and such a
scene!&nbsp; Towards the left bank of the river, a forest of
masts, thick and close, as far as the eye could reach; spacious
wharfs, surmounted with gigantic edifices; and, far away,
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Castle, with its White Tower.&nbsp; To the
right, another forest of masts, and a maze of buildings, from
which, here and there, shot up to the sky chimneys taller than
Cleopatra&rsquo;s Needle, vomiting forth huge wreaths of that
black smoke which forms the canopy&mdash;occasionally a gorgeous
one&mdash;of the more than Babel city.&nbsp; Stretching before
me, the troubled breast of the mighty river, and, immediately
below, the main whirlpool of the Thames&mdash;the Ma&euml;lstrom
of the bulwarks of the middle arch&mdash;a grisly pool, which,
with its superabundance of horror, fascinated me.&nbsp; Who knows
but I should have leapt into its depths?&mdash;I have heard of
such things&mdash;but for a rather startling occurrence which
broke the spell.&nbsp; As I stood upon the bridge, gazing into
the jaws <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>of the pool, a small boat shot
suddenly through the arch beneath my feet.&nbsp; There were three
persons in it; an oarsman in the middle, whilst a man and woman
sat at the stern.&nbsp; I shall never forget the thrill of horror
which went through me at this sudden apparition.&nbsp;
What!&mdash;a boat&mdash;a small boat&mdash;passing beneath that
arch into yonder roaring gulf!&nbsp; Yes, yes, down through that
awful water-way, with more than the swiftness of an arrow, shot
the boat, or skiff, right into the jaws of the pool.&nbsp; A
monstrous breaker curls over the prow&mdash;there is no hope; the
boat is swamped, and all drowned in that strangling vortex!&nbsp;
No! the boat, which appeared to have the buoyancy of a feather,
skipped over the threatening horror, and, the next moment, was
out of danger, the boatman&mdash;a true boatman of Cockaigne
that&mdash;elevating one of his sculls in sign of triumph, the
man hallooing, and the woman, a true Englishwoman that&mdash;of a
certain class&mdash;waving her shawl.&nbsp; Whether any one
observed them save myself, or whether the feat was a common one,
I know not; but nobody appeared to take any notice of them.&nbsp;
As for myself, I was so excited, that I strove to clamber up the
balustrade of the bridge, in order to obtain a better view of the
daring adventurers.&nbsp; Before I could accomplish my design,
however, I felt myself seized by the body, and, turning my head,
perceived the old fruit-woman, who was clinging to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, dear! don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fling yourself over&mdash;perhaps
you may have better luck next time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not going to fling myself over,&rdquo; said I,
dropping from the balustrade; &ldquo;how came you to think of
such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>&ldquo;Why, seeing you clamber up so fiercely, I
thought you might have had ill luck, and that you wished to make
away with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill luck,&rdquo; said I, going into the stone bower,
and sitting down.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean? ill luck in
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no great harm, dear! clyfaking perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you coming over me with dialects,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;speaking unto me in fashions I wot nothing of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, dear! don&rsquo;t look so strange with those eyes
of your&rsquo;n, nor talk so strangely; I don&rsquo;t understand
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I you; what do you mean by clyfaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, dear! no harm; only taking a handkerchief now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, dear! don&rsquo;t make use of bad language; we
never calls them thieves here, but prigs and fakers: to tell you
the truth, dear, seeing you spring at that railing put me in mind
of my own dear son, who is now at Bot&rsquo;ny: when he had bad
luck, he always used to talk of flinging himself over the bridge;
and, sure enough, when the traps were after him, he did fling
himself into the river, but that was off the bank; nevertheless,
the traps pulled him out, and he is now suffering his sentence;
so you see you may speak out, if you have done anything in the
harmless line, for I am my son&rsquo;s own mother, I assure
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think there&rsquo;s no harm in
stealing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm in the world, dear!&nbsp; Do you think my own
child would have been transported for it, <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>if there
had been any harm in it? and, what&rsquo;s more, would the
blessed woman in the book here have written her life as she has
done, and given it to the world, if there had been any harm in
faking?&nbsp; She, too, was what they call a thief and a
cut-purse; ay, and was transported for it, like my dear son; and
do you think she would have told the world so, if there had been
any harm in the thing?&nbsp; Oh, it is a comfort to me that the
blessed woman was transported, and came back&mdash;for come back
she did, and rich too&mdash;for it is an assurance to me that my
dear son, who was transported too, will come back like
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name, blessed Mary Flanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me look at the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, that I will, if you promise me not to run
away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the book from her hand; a short thick volume, at least
a century old, bound with greasy black leather.&nbsp; I turned
the yellow and dog&rsquo;s-eared pages, reading here and there a
sentence.&nbsp; Yes, and no mistake!&nbsp; <i>His</i> pen, his
style, his spirit might be observed in every line of the
uncouth-looking old volume&mdash;the air, the style, the spirit
of the writer of the book which first taught me to read. <a
name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287"
class="citation">[287]</a>&nbsp; I covered my face with my hand,
and thought of my childhood . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a singular book,&rdquo; said I at last;
&ldquo;but it does not appear to have been written to prove that
thieving is no harm, but rather to show the terrible consequences
of crime: it contains a deep moral.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>&ldquo;A deep what, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A . . . but no matter; I will give you a crown for this
volume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, I will not sell the volume for a
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am poor,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I will give you
two silver crowns for your volume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, I will not sell my volume for two silver
crowns; no, nor for the golden one in the king&rsquo;s Tower down
there; without my book I should mope and pine, and perhaps fling
myself into the river; but I am glad you like it, which shows
that I was right about you, after all; you are one of our party,
and you have a flash about that eye of yours which puts me just
in mind of my dear son.&nbsp; No, dear, I won&rsquo;t sell you my
book; but, if you like, you may have a peep into it whenever you
come this way.&nbsp; I shall be glad to see you; you are one of
the right sort, for, if you had been a common one, you would have
run away with the thing; but you scorn such behaviour, and, as
you are so flash of your money, though you say you are poor, you
may give me a tanner to buy a little baccy with; I love baccy,
dear, more by token that it comes from the plantations to which
the blessed woman was sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a tanner?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor! don&rsquo;t you know, dear?&nbsp; Why, a tanner is
sixpence; and, as you were talking just now about crowns, it will
be as well to tell you that those of our trade never calls them
crowns, but bulls; but I am talking nonsense, just as if you did
not know all that already, as well as myself; you are only
shamming&mdash;I&rsquo;m no trap, dear, nor more was the blessed
woman in the book.&nbsp; Thank <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>you,
dear&mdash;thank you for the tanner; if I don&rsquo;t spend it,
I&rsquo;ll keep it in remembrance of your sweet face.&nbsp; What,
you are going?&mdash;well, first let me whisper a word to
you.&nbsp; If you have any clies to sell at any time, I&rsquo;ll
buy them of you; all safe with me; I never &rsquo;peach, and
scorns a trap; so now, dear, God bless you! and give you good
luck.&nbsp; Thank you for your pleasant company, and thank you
for the tanner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tanner&mdash;The Hotel&mdash;Drinking Claret&mdash;London
Journal&mdash;New Field&mdash;Commonplaceness&mdash;The Three
Individuals&mdash;Botheration&mdash;Frank and Ardent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tanner!&rdquo; said I, musingly, as I left the
bridge; &ldquo;Tanner! what can the man who cures raw skins by
means of a preparation of oak bark and other materials have to do
with the name which these fakers, as they call themselves, bestow
on the smallest silver coin in these dominions?&nbsp;
Tanner!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t trace the connection between the man
of bark and the silver coin, unless journeymen tanners are in the
habit of working for sixpence a day.&nbsp; But I have it,&rdquo;
I continued, flourishing my hat over my head, &ldquo;tanner, in
this instance, is not an English word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not
surprising that the language of Mr. Petulengro and of Tawno
Chikno is continually coming to my assistance whenever I appear
to be at a nonplus with respect to the derivation of crabbed
words?&nbsp; I have made out crabbed words in &AElig;schylus by
means of the speech of Chikno and Petulengro, and even in my
Biblical researches I have derived no slight assistance from
it.&nbsp; It appears to be a kind of picklock, an open sesame,
Tanner&mdash;Tawno! the one is but a modification of the other;
<!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>they were originally identical, and have still much the
same signification.&nbsp; Tanner, in the language of the
apple-woman, meaneth the smallest of English silver coins; and
Tawno, in the language of the Petulengres, though bestowed upon
the biggest of the Romans, according to strict interpretation,
signifieth a little child.</p>
<p>So I left the bridge, retracing my steps for a considerable
way, as I thought I had seen enough in the direction in which I
had hitherto been wandering; I should say that I scarcely walked
less than thirty miles about the big city on the day of my first
arrival.&nbsp; Night came on, but still I was walking about, my
eyes wide open, and admiring everything that presented itself to
them.&nbsp; Everything was new to me, for everything is different
in London from what it is elsewhere&mdash;the people, their
language, the horses, the <i>tout ensemble</i>&mdash;even the
stones of London are different from others&mdash;at least it
appeared to me that I had never walked with the same ease and
facility on the flagstones of a country town as on those of
London; so I continued roving about till night came on, and then
the splendour of some of the shops particularly struck me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A regular Arabian Nights&rsquo; entertainment!&rdquo; said
I, as I looked into one on Cornhill, gorgeous with precious
merchandise, and lighted up with lustres, the rays of which were
reflected from a hundred mirrors.</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding the excellence of the London pavement, I
began about nine o&rsquo;clock to feel myself thoroughly tired;
painfully and slowly did I drag my feet along.&nbsp; I also felt
very much in want of some refreshment, and I remembered <!-- page
292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>that since breakfast I had taken nothing.&nbsp; I was
now in the Strand, and, glancing about, I perceived that I was
close by an hotel, which bore over the door the somewhat
remarkable name of Holy Lands.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation I entered a well-lighted passage, and, turning to the
left, I found myself in a well-lighted coffee-room, with a
well-dressed and frizzled waiter before me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring me
some claret,&rdquo; said I, for I was rather faint than hungry,
and I felt ashamed to give a humbler order to so well-dressed an
individual.&nbsp; The waiter looked at me for a moment; then,
making a low bow, he bustled off, and I sat myself down in the
box nearest to the window.&nbsp; Presently the waiter returned,
bearing beneath his left arm a long bottle, and between the
fingers of his right hand two large purple glasses; placing the
latter on the table, he produced a cork-screw, drew the cork in a
twinkling, set the bottle down before me with a bang, and then,
standing still, appeared to watch my movements.&nbsp; You think I
don&rsquo;t know how to drink a glass of claret, thought I to
myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon show you how we drink claret where
I come from; and, filling one of the glasses to the brim, I
flickered it for a moment between my eyes and the lustre, and
then held it to my nose; having given that organ full time to
test the bouquet of the wine, I applied the glass to my lips,
taking a large mouthful of the wine, which I swallowed slowly and
by degrees, that the palate might likewise have an opportunity of
performing its functions.&nbsp; A second mouthful I disposed of
more summarily; then, placing the empty glass upon the table, I
fixed my eyes upon the bottle, and said&mdash;nothing; whereupon
the waiter, who had been observing the whole <!-- page 293--><a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>process
with considerable attention, made me a bow yet more low than
before, and, turning on his heel, retired with a smart chuck of
his head, as much as to say, It is all right; the young man is
used to claret.</p>
<p>And when the waiter had retired I took a second glass of the
wine, which I found excellent; and, observing a newspaper lying
near me, I took it up and began perusing it.&nbsp; It has been
observed somewhere that people who are in the habit of reading
newspapers every day are not unfrequently struck with the
excellence of style and general talent which they display.&nbsp;
Now, if that be the case, how must I have been surprised, who was
reading a newspaper for the first time, and that one of the best
of the London journals!&nbsp; Yes, strange as it may seem, it was
nevertheless true that, up to the moment of which I am speaking,
I had never read a newspaper of any description. <a
name="citation293"></a><a href="#footnote293"
class="citation">[293]</a>&nbsp; I of course had frequently seen
journals, and even handled them; but, as for reading them, what
were they to me?&mdash;I cared not for news.&nbsp; But here I was
now with my claret before me, perusing, perhaps, the best of all
the London journals&mdash;it was not the ---&mdash;and I was
astonished: an entirely new field of literature appeared to be
opened to my view.&nbsp; It was a discovery, but I confess rather
an unpleasant one; for I said to myself, if literary talent is so
very common in London, that the journals, things which, as their
very name denotes, are ephemeral, are written in a style like the
article I have been perusing, how can I hope to distinguish
myself in this big town, when, for the life of me, I don&rsquo;t
think I could write anything half so clever as what <!-- page
294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>I
have been reading.&nbsp; And then I laid down the paper, and fell
into deep musing; rousing myself from which, I took a glass of
wine, and, pouring out another, began musing again.&nbsp; What I
have been reading, thought I, is certainly very clever and very
talented; but talent and cleverness I think I have heard some one
say are very commonplace things, only fitted for everyday
occasions.&nbsp; I question whether the man who wrote the book I
saw this day on the bridge was a clever man; but, after all, was
he not something much better?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he could
have written this article, but then he wrote the book which I saw
on the bridge.&nbsp; Then, if he could not have written the
article on which I now hold my forefinger&mdash;and I do not
believe he could&mdash;why should I feel discouraged at the
consciousness that I, too, could not write it?&nbsp; I certainly
could no more have written the article than he could; but then,
like him, though I would not compare myself to the man who wrote
the book I saw upon the bridge, I think I could&mdash;and here I
emptied the glass of claret&mdash;write something better.</p>
<p>Thereupon I resumed the newspaper; and, as I was before struck
with the fluency of style and the general talent which it
displayed, I was now equally so with its commonplaceness and want
of originality on every subject; and it was evident to me that,
whatever advantage these newspaper-writers might have over me in
some points, they had never studied the Welsh bards, translated
K&oelig;mpe Viser, or been under the pupilage of Mr. Petulengro
and Tawno Chikno.</p>
<p>And as I sat conning the newspaper three individuals entered
the room, and seated themselves <!-- page 295--><a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>in the box
at the farther end of which I was.&nbsp; They were all three very
well dressed; two of them elderly gentlemen, the third a young
man about my own age, or perhaps a year or two older: they called
for coffee; and, after two or three observations, the two eldest
commenced a conversation in French, which, however, though they
spoke it fluently enough, I perceived at once was not their
native language; the young man, however, took no part in their
conversation, and when they addressed a portion to him, which
indeed was but rarely, merely replied by a monosyllable.&nbsp; I
have never been a listener, and I paid but little heed to their
discourse, nor indeed to themselves; as I occasionally looked up,
however, I could perceive that the features of the young man, who
chanced to be seated exactly opposite to me, wore an air of
constraint and vexation.&nbsp; This circumstance caused me to
observe him more particularly than I otherwise should have done:
his features were handsome and prepossessing; he had dark brown
hair and a high-arched forehead.&nbsp; After the lapse of half an
hour, the two elder individuals, having finished their coffee,
called for the waiter, and then rose as if to depart, the young
man, however, still remaining seated in the box.&nbsp; The
others, having reached the door, turned round, and, finding that
the youth did not follow them, one of them called to him with a
tone of some authority; whereupon the young man rose, and,
pronouncing half audibly the word &ldquo;botheration,&rdquo; rose
and followed them.&nbsp; I now observed that he was remarkably
tall.&nbsp; All three left the house.&nbsp; In about ten minutes,
finding nothing more worth reading in the newspaper, I laid it
down, and though the claret was not yet <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>exhausted,
I was thinking of betaking myself to my lodgings, and was about
to call the waiter, when I heard a step in the passage, and in
another moment the tall young man entered the room, advanced to
the same box, and, sitting down nearly opposite to me, again
pronounced to himself, but more audibly than before, the same
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A troublesome world this, sir,&rdquo; said I, looking
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young man, looking fixedly at me;
&ldquo;but I am afraid we bring most of our troubles on our own
heads&mdash;at least I can say so of myself,&rdquo; he added,
laughing.&nbsp; Then, after a pause, &ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but am I not addressing one of my own
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what country are you?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not of your country, sir; but I have an infinite
veneration for your country, as Strap said to the French
soldier.&nbsp; Will you take a glass of wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>de tout mon c&oelig;ur</i>, as the parasite said
to Gil Blas,&rdquo; cried the young man, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to our better acquaintance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And better acquainted we soon became; and I found that, in
making the acquaintance of the young man, I had, indeed, made a
valuable acquisition; he was accomplished, highly connected, and
bore the name of Francis Ardry.&nbsp; Frank and ardent he was,
and in a very little time had told me much that related to
himself, and in return I communicated a general outline of my own
history; he listened with profound attention, but laughed
heartily when I told him some particulars of my <!-- page

frequently heard of.</p>
<p>We left the house together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon see each other again,&rdquo; said he, as
we separated at the door of my lodging.</p>

<p>On the Sunday I was punctual to my appointment to dine with
the publisher.&nbsp; As I hurried along the square in which his
house stood, my thoughts were fixed so intently on the great man,
that I passed by him without seeing him.&nbsp; He had observed
me, however, and joined me just as I was about to knock at the

he; &ldquo;we shall not dine for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, as we were walking in the square,
&ldquo;what have you been doing since I last saw you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been looking about London,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and I have bought the &lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughter&rsquo;; here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray put it up,&rdquo; said the publisher; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to look at such trash.&nbsp; Well, do you think
you could write anything like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said the publisher, looking at
me.</p>
<p><!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the man who wrote
it seems to be perfectly well acquainted with his subject; and,
moreover, to write from the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the subject you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you acquainted with
religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said the publisher,
seriously, &ldquo;for he who sets up for an author ought to be
acquainted not only with religion, but religions, and indeed with
all subjects, like my good friend in the country.&nbsp; It is
well that I have changed my mind about the
&lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter,&rsquo; or I really don&rsquo;t
know whom I could apply to on the subject at the present moment,
unless to himself; and after all I question whether his style is
exactly suited for an evangelical novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do not wish for an imitation of the
&lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, sir; I have changed my mind, as I told you
before; I wish to employ you in another line, but will
communicate to you my intentions after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner, beside the publisher and myself, were present his
wife and son, with his newly married bride; the wife appeared a
quiet respectable woman, and the young people looked very happy
and good-natured; not so the publisher, who occasionally eyed
both with contempt and dislike.&nbsp; Connected with this dinner
there was one thing remarkable; the publisher took no animal
food, but contented himself with feeding voraciously on rice and
vegetables prepared in various ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You eat no animal food, sir?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, sir,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have forsworn
it <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>upwards of twenty years.&nbsp; In one respect, sir, I
am a Brahmin.&nbsp; I abhor taking away life&mdash;the brutes
have as much right to live as ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if the brutes were not
killed, there would be such a superabundance of them, that the
land would be overrun with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think so, sir; few are killed in India, and
yet there is plenty of room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;nature intended that they
should be destroyed, and the brutes themselves prey upon one
another, and it is well for themselves and the world that they do
so.&nbsp; What would be the state of things if every insect,
bird, and worm were left to perish of old age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will change the subject,&rdquo; said the publisher;
&ldquo;I have never been a friend of unprofitable
discussions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the publisher with some surprise, I had not been
accustomed to be spoken to so magisterially; his countenance was
dressed in a portentous frown, and his eye looked more sinister
than ever; at that moment he put me in mind of some of those
despots of whom I had read in the history of Morocco, whose word
was law.&nbsp; He merely wants power, thought I to myself, to be
a regular Muley Mehemet; and then I sighed, for I remembered how
very much I was in the power of that man.</p>
<p>The dinner over, the publisher nodded to his wife, who
departed, followed by her daughter-in-law.&nbsp; The son looked
as if he would willingly have attended them; he, however,
remained seated; and, a small decanter of wine being placed on
the table, the publisher filled two glasses, one of which he
handed to myself, and the other to his son; <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>saying,
&ldquo;Suppose you two drink to the success of the Review.&nbsp;
I would join you,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to me,
&ldquo;but I drink no wine; if I am a Brahmin with respect to
meat, I am a Mahometan with respect to wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the son and I drank success to the Review, and then the
young man asked me various questions; for example&mdash;How I
liked London?&mdash;Whether I did not think it a very fine
place?&mdash;Whether I was at the play the night
before?&mdash;and Whether I was in the park that afternoon?&nbsp;
He seemed preparing to ask me some more questions; but, receiving
a furious look from his father, he became silent, filled himself
a glass of wine, drank it off, looked at the table for about a
minute, then got up, pushed back his chair, made me a bow, and
left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that young gentleman, sir,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;well versed in the principles of criticism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not, sir,&rdquo; said the publisher; &ldquo;and,
if I place him at the head of the Review ostensibly, I do it
merely in the hope of procuring him a maintenance; of the
principle of a thing he knows nothing, except that the principle
of bread is wheat, and that the principle of that wine is
grape.&nbsp; Will you take another glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the decanter; but, not feeling altogether so sure
as the publisher&rsquo;s son with respect to the principle of
what it contained, I declined taking any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, adjusting himself
in his chair, &ldquo;he knows nothing about criticism, and will
have nothing more to do with the reviewals than carrying about
the books to those who have to review them; the real conductor of
<!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>the Review will be a widely different person, to whom I
will, when convenient, introduce you.&nbsp; And now we will talk
of the matter which we touched upon before dinner: I told you
then that I had changed my mind with respect to you; I have been
considering the state of the market, sir, the book market, and I
have come to the conclusion that, though you might be profitably
employed upon evangelical novels, you could earn more money for
me, sir, and consequently for yourself, by a compilation of
Newgate lives and trials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newgate lives and trials!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;Newgate
lives and trials; and now, sir, I will briefly state to you the
services which I expect you to perform, and the terms which I am
willing to grant.&nbsp; I expect you, sir, to compile six volumes
of Newgate lives and trials, each volume to contain by no manner
of means less than one thousand pages; the remuneration which you
will receive when the work is completed will be fifty pounds,
which is likewise intended to cover any expenses you may incur in
procuring books, papers, and manuscripts necessary for the
compilation.&nbsp; Such will be one of your employments,
sir,&mdash;such the terms.&nbsp; In the second place, you will be
expected to make yourself useful in the Review&mdash;generally
useful, sir&mdash;doing whatever is required of you; for it is
not customary, at least with me, to permit writers, especially
young writers, to choose their subjects.&nbsp; In these two
departments, sir, namely, compilation and reviewing, I had
yesterday, after due consideration, determined upon employing
you.&nbsp; I had intended to employ you no farther, sir&mdash;at
least for the present; but, sir, this morning I received a letter
<!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>from my valued friend in the country, in which he
speaks in terms of strong admiration (I don&rsquo;t overstate) of
your German acquirements.&nbsp; Sir, he says that it would be a
thousand pities if your knowledge of the German language should
be lost to the world, or even permitted to sleep, and he entreats
me to think of some plan by which it may be turned to
account.&nbsp; Sir, I am at all times willing, if possible, to
oblige my worthy friend, and likewise to encourage merit and
talent; I have, therefore, determined to employ you in
German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, rubbing my hands, &ldquo;you are
very kind, and so is our mutual friend; I shall be happy to make
myself useful in German; and if you think a good translation from
Goethe&mdash;his &lsquo;Sorrows&rsquo; for example, or more
particularly his &lsquo;Faust&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;Goethe is a
drug; his &lsquo;Sorrows&rsquo; are a drug, so is his
&lsquo;Faustus,&rsquo; more especially the last, since that fool
--- rendered him into English.&nbsp; No, sir, I do not want you
to translate Goethe or anything belonging to him; nor do I want
you to translate anything from the German; what I want you to do,
is to translate into German.&nbsp; I am willing to encourage
merit, sir; and, as my good friend in his last letter has spoken
very highly of your German acquirements, I have determined that
you shall translate my book of philosophy into German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your book of philosophy into German, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; my book of philosophy into German.&nbsp; I am
not a drug, sir, in Germany as Goethe is here, no more is my
book.&nbsp; I intend to print the translation at Leipzig, sir;
and if it turns out a profitable speculation, as I make no doubt
it <!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>will, provided the translation be well executed, I will
make you some remuneration.&nbsp; Sir, your remuneration will be
determined by the success of your translation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, interrupting me,
&ldquo;you have heard my intentions; I consider that you ought to
feel yourself highly gratified by my intentions towards you; it
is not frequently that I deal with a writer, especially a young
writer, as I have done with you.&nbsp; And now, sir, permit me to
inform you that I wish to be alone.&nbsp; This is Sunday
afternoon, sir; I never go to church, but I am in the habit of
spending part of every Sunday afternoon alone&mdash;profitably I
hope, sir&mdash;in musing on the magnificence of nature and the
moral dignity of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Two Volumes&mdash;A Young Author&mdash;Intended
Editor&mdash;Quintilian&mdash;Loose Money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can&rsquo;t be cured must be endured,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;it is hard to kick against the pricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the period to which I have brought my history, I bethought
me of the proverbs with which I have headed this chapter, and
determined to act up to their spirit.&nbsp; I determined not to
fly in the face of the publisher, and to bear&mdash;what I could
not cure&mdash;his arrogance and vanity.&nbsp; At present, at the
conclusion of nearly a quarter of a century, I am glad that I
came to that determination, which I did my best to carry into
effect.</p>
<p>Two or three days after our last interview, the publisher made
his appearance in my apartment; he bore two tattered volumes
under his arm, which he placed on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
brought you two volumes of lives, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;which I yesterday found in my garret; you will find them
of service for your compilation.&nbsp; As I always wish to behave
liberally and encourage talent, especially youthful talent, I
shall make no charge for them, though I should be justified in so
doing, as you are aware that, by our agreement, you are to
provide any <!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>books and materials which may be
necessary.&nbsp; Have you been in quest of any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, I would advise you to lose no time in doing
so; you must visit all the bookstalls, sir, especially those in
the by-streets and blind alleys.&nbsp; It is in such places that
you will find the description of literature you are in want
of.&nbsp; You must be up and doing, sir; it will not do for an
author, especially a young author, to be idle in this town.&nbsp;
To-night you will receive my book of philosophy, and likewise
books for the Review.&nbsp; And, by the bye, sir, it will be as
well for you to review my book of philosophy for the Review; the
other reviews not having noticed it.&nbsp; Sir, before
translating it, I wish you to review my book of philosophy for
the Review.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be happy to do my best, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir; I should be unreasonable to expect
anything beyond a person&rsquo;s best.&nbsp; And now, sir, if you
please, I will conduct you to the future editor of the Review. <a
name="citation306"></a><a href="#footnote306"
class="citation">[306]</a>&nbsp; As you are to co-operate, sir, I
deem it right to make you acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intended editor was a little old man, who sat in a kind of
wooden pavilion in a small garden behind a house in one of the
purlieus of the city, composing tunes upon a piano.&nbsp; The
walls of the pavilion were covered with fiddles of various sizes
<!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>and appearances, and a considerable portion of the
floor occupied by a pile of books all of one size.&nbsp; The
publisher introduced him to me as a gentleman scarcely less
eminent in literature than in music, and me to him as an aspirant
critic&mdash;a young gentleman scarcely less eminent in
philosophy than in philology.&nbsp; The conversation consisted
entirely of compliments till just before we separated, when the
future editor inquired of me whether I had ever read Quintilian;
and, on my replying in the negative, expressed his surprise that
any gentleman should aspire to become a critic who had never read
Quintilian, with the comfortable information, however, that he
could supply me with a Quintilian at half-price, that is, a
translation made by himself some years previously, of which he
had, pointing to the heap on the floor, still a few copies
remaining unsold.&nbsp; For some reason or other, perhaps a poor
one, I did not purchase the editor&rsquo;s translation of
Quintilian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, as we were returning
from our visit to the editor, &ldquo;you did right in not
purchasing a drug.&nbsp; I am not prepared, sir, to say that
Quintilian is a drug, never having seen him; but I am prepared to
say that man&rsquo;s translation is a drug, judging from the heap
of rubbish on the floor; besides, sir, you will want any loose
money you may have to purchase the description of literature
which is required for your compilation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher presently paused before the entrance of a very
forlorn-looking street.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, after
looking down it with attention, &ldquo;I should not wonder if in
that street you find works connected with the description of
literature which is required for your compilation.&nbsp; It is in
streets of <!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>this description, sir, and blind
alleys, where such works are to be found.&nbsp; You had better
search that street, sir, whilst I continue my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I searched the street to which the publisher had pointed, and,
in the course of the three succeeding days, many others of a
similar kind.&nbsp; I did not find the description of literature
alluded to by the publisher to be a drug, but, on the contrary,
both scarce and dear.&nbsp; I had expended much more than my
loose money long before I could procure materials even for the
first volume of my compilation.</p>

<p>Francis Ardry&mdash;Certain Sharpers&mdash;Brave and
Eloquent&mdash;Opposites&mdash;Flinging the Bones&mdash;Strange
Places&mdash;Dog-Fighting&mdash;Learning and Letters&mdash;Batch
of Dogs&mdash;Redoubled Application.</p>
<p>One evening I was visited by the tall young gentleman, Francis
Ardry, whose acquaintance I had formed at the coffee-house.&nbsp;
As it is necessary that the reader should know something more
about this young man, who will frequently appear in the course of
these pages, I will state in a few words who and what he
was.&nbsp; He was born of an ancient Roman Catholic family in
Ireland; his parents, whose only child he was, had long been
dead.&nbsp; His father, who had survived his mother several
years, had been a spendthrift, and at his death had left the
family property considerably embarrassed.&nbsp; Happily, however,
the son and the estate fell into the hands of careful guardians,
near relations of the family, by whom the property was managed to
the best advantage, and every means taken to educate the young
man in a manner suitable to his expectations.&nbsp; At the age of
sixteen he was taken from a celebrated school in England at which
he had been placed, and sent to a small French university, in
order that he might form an <!-- page 310--><a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>intimate
and accurate acquaintance with the grand language of the
Continent.&nbsp; There he continued three years, at the end of
which he went under the care of a French abb&eacute; to Germany
and Italy.&nbsp; It was in this latter country that he first
began to cause his guardians serious uneasiness.&nbsp; He was in
the hey-day of youth when he visited Italy, and he entered wildly
into the various delights of that fascinating region, and, what
was worse, falling into the hands of certain sharpers, not
Italian, but English, he was fleeced of considerable sums of
money.&nbsp; The abb&eacute;, who, it seems, was an excellent
individual of the old French school, remonstrated with his pupil
on his dissipation and extravagance; but, finding his
remonstrances vain, very properly informed the guardians of the
manner of life of his charge.&nbsp; They were not slow in
commanding Francis Ardry home; and, as he was entirely in their
power, he was forced to comply.&nbsp; He had been about three
months in London when I met him in the coffee-room, and the two
elderly gentlemen in his company were his guardians.&nbsp; At
this time they were very solicitous that he should choose for
himself a profession, offering to his choice either the army or
law&mdash;he was calculated to shine in either of these
professions&mdash;for, like many others of his countrymen, he was
brave and eloquent; but he did not wish to shackle himself with a
profession.&nbsp; As, however, his minority did not terminate
till he was three-and-twenty, of which age he wanted nearly two
years, during which he would be entirely dependent on his
guardians, he deemed it expedient to conceal, to a certain
degree, his sentiments, temporising with the old gentlemen, with
whom, notwithstanding <!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>his many irregularities, he was a
great favourite, and at whose death he expected to come into a
yet greater property than that which he inherited from his
parents.</p>
<p>Such is a brief account of Francis Ardry&mdash;of my friend
Francis Ardry; for the acquaintance, commenced in the singular
manner with which the reader is acquainted, speedily ripened into
a friendship which endured through many long years of separation,
and which still endures certainly on my part, and on his&mdash;if
he lives; but it is many years since I have heard from Francis
Ardry.</p>
<p>And yet many people would have thought it impossible for our
friendship to have lasted a week&mdash;for in many respects no
two people could be more dissimilar.&nbsp; He was an
Irishman&mdash;I, an Englishman;&mdash;he, fiery, enthusiastic,
and open-hearted;&mdash;I, neither fiery, enthusiastic, nor
open-hearted;&mdash;he, fond of pleasure and
dissipation;&mdash;I, of study and reflection.&nbsp; Yet it is of
such dissimilar elements that the most lasting friendships are
formed: we do not like counterparts of ourselves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Two great talkers will not travel far together,&rdquo; is
a Spanish saying; I will add, &ldquo;Nor two silent
people;&rdquo; we naturally love our opposites.</p>
<p>So Francis Ardry came to see me, and right glad I was to see
him, for I had just flung my books and papers aside, and was
wishing for a little social converse; and when we had conversed
for some little time together, Francis Ardry proposed that we
should go to the play to see Kean; so we went to the play, and
saw&mdash;not Kean, who at that time was ashamed to show himself,
but&mdash;a man who was not ashamed to show himself, and who
people said was a much better <!-- page 312--><a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>man than
Kean&mdash;as I have no doubt he was&mdash;though whether he was
a better actor I cannot say, for I never saw Kean.</p>
<p>Two or three evenings after Francis Ardry came to see me
again, and again we went out together, and Francis Ardry took me
to&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;why not?&mdash;a gaming house, where
I saw people playing, and where I saw Francis Ardry play and lose
five guineas, and where I lost nothing, because I did not play,
though I felt somewhat inclined; for a man with a white hat and a
sparkling eye held up a box which contained something which
rattled, and asked me to fling the bones.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
nothing like flinging the bones!&rdquo; said he, and then I
thought I should like to know what kind of thing flinging the
bones was; I, however, restrained myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
nothing like flinging the bones!&rdquo; shouted the man, as my
friend and myself left the room.</p>
<p>Long life and prosperity to Francis Ardry! but for him I
should not have obtained knowledge which I did of the strange and
eccentric places of London.&nbsp; Some of the places to which he
took me were very strange places indeed; but, however strange the
places were, I observed that the inhabitants thought there were
no places like their several places, and no occupations like
their several occupations; and among other strange places to
which Francis Ardry conducted me, was a place not far from the
abbey church of Westminster.</p>
<p>Before we entered this place our ears were greeted by a
confused hubbub of human voices, squealing of rats, barking of
dogs, and the cries of various other animals.&nbsp; Here we
beheld a kind of cock-pit, around which a great many people, <!--
page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>seeming of all ranks, but chiefly of the lower, were
gathered, and in it we saw a dog destroy a great many rats in a
very small period; and when the dog had destroyed the rats, we
saw a fight between a dog and a bear, then a fight between two
dogs, then . . .</p>
<p>After the diversions of the day were over, my friend
introduced me to the genius of the place, a small man of about
five feet high, with a very sharp countenance, and dressed in a
brown jockey coat, and top-boots.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joey,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;this is a friend of mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joey nodded to
me with a patronising air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glad to see you,
sir!&mdash;want a dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have got one, then&mdash;want to match
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a dog at home,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in the
country; but I can&rsquo;t say I should like to match him.&nbsp;
Indeed, I do not like dog-fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like dog-fighting!&rdquo; said the man,
staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, Joe, that he is just come to
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I should think; he looks rather green&mdash;not like
dog-fighting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it, is there, Joey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not; what is like it?&nbsp; A time will
come, and that speedily, when folks will give up everything else,
and follow dog-fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so?&nbsp; Let me ask what there is that a man
wouldn&rsquo;t give up for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, modestly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion!&nbsp; How you talk!&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s
myself, bred and born an Independent, and intended to be a
preacher, didn&rsquo;t I give up religion for dog-fighting?&nbsp;
<!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>Religion, indeed!&nbsp; If it were not for the rascally
law, my pit would fill better on Sundays than any other
time.&nbsp; Who would go to church when they could come to my
pit?&nbsp; Religion! why, the parsons themselves come to my pit;
and I have now a letter in my pocket from one of them, asking me
to send him a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, politics,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Politics!&nbsp; Why the gemmen in the House would leave
Pitt himself, if he were alive, to come to my pit.&nbsp; There
were three of the best of them here to-night, all great
horators.&mdash;Get on with you! what comes next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s learning and letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty things, truly, to keep people from
dog-fighting.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s the young gentlemen from
the Abbey School comes here in shoals, leaving books, and
letters, and masters too.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I rather
wish they would mind their letters, for a more precious set of
young blackguards I never see&rsquo;d.&nbsp; It was only the
other day I was thinking of calling in a constable for my own
protection, for I thought my pit would have been torn down by
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing what to say, I made an observation at
random.&nbsp; &ldquo;You show, by your own conduct,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;that there are other things worth following besides
dog-fighting.&nbsp; You practise rat-catching and badger-baiting
as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog-fancier eyed me with supreme contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;might well
call you a new one.&nbsp; When I talks of dog-fighting, I of
course means rat-catching, and badger-baiting, ay, and
bull-baiting too, just as when I speaks religiously, when I says
one I means not one but <!-- page 315--><a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>three.&nbsp; And talking of religion puts me in mind
that I have something else to do besides chaffing here, having a
batch of dogs to send off by this night&rsquo;s packet to the
Pope of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at last I had seen enough of what London had to show,
whether strange or commonplace, so at least I thought, and I
ceased to accompany my friend in his rambles about town, and to
partake of his adventures.&nbsp; Our friendship, however, still
continued unabated, though I saw, in consequence, less of
him.&nbsp; I reflected that time was passing on&mdash;that the
little money I had brought to town was fast consuming, and that I
had nothing to depend upon but my own exertions for a fresh
supply; and I returned with redoubled application to my
pursuits.</p>

this last task I experienced more than one difficulty.&nbsp; I
was a tolerable German scholar, it is true, and I had long been
able to translate from German into English with considerable
facility; but to translate from a foreign language into your own,
is a widely different thing from translating from your own into a
foreign language; and, in my first attempt to render the
publisher into German, I was conscious of making miserable
failures, from pure ignorance of German grammar; however, by the
assistance of grammars and dictionaries, and by extreme
perseverance, I at length overcame all the difficulties connected
with the German language.&nbsp; But, alas! another difficulty
remained, far greater than any connected <!-- page 317--><a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>with
German&mdash;a difficulty connected with the language of the
publisher&mdash;the language which the great man employed in his
writings was very hard to understand; I say in his
writings&mdash;for his colloquial English was plain enough.&nbsp;
Though not professing to be a scholar, he was much addicted, when
writing, to the use of Greek and Latin terms, not as other people
used them, but in a manner of his own, which set the authority of
dictionaries at defiance; the consequence was, that I was
sometimes utterly at a loss to understand the meaning of the
publisher.&nbsp; Many a quarter of an hour did I pass at this
period, staring at periods of the publisher, and wondering what
he could mean, but in vain, till at last, with a shake of the
head, I would snatch up the pen, and render the publisher
literally into German.&nbsp; Sometimes I was almost tempted to
substitute something of my own for what the publisher had
written, but my conscience interposed; the awful words,
Traduttore traditore, commenced ringing in my ears, and I asked
myself whether I should be acting honourably towards the
publisher, who had committed to me the delicate task of
translating him into German; should I be acting honourably
towards him, in making him speak in German in a manner different
from that in which he expressed himself in English?&nbsp; No, I
could not reconcile such conduct with any principle of honour; by
substituting something of my own in lieu of these mysterious
passages of the publisher, I might be giving a fatal blow to his
whole system of philosophy.&nbsp; Besides, when translating into
English, had I treated foreign authors in this manner?&nbsp; Had
I treated the minstrels of the K&oelig;mpe Viser in this
manner?&mdash;<!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>No.&nbsp; Had I treated Ab Gwilym in
this manner?&nbsp; Even when translating his Ode to the Mist, in
which he is misty enough, had I attempted to make Ab Gwilym less
misty?&nbsp; No; on referring to my translation, I found that Ab
Gwilym in my hands was quite as misty as in his own.&nbsp; Then,
seeing that I had not ventured to take liberties with people who
had never put themselves into my hands for the purpose of being
rendered, how could I venture to substitute my own thoughts and
ideas for the publisher&rsquo;s, who had put himself into my
hands for that purpose?&nbsp; Forbid it every proper
feeling!&mdash;so I told the Germans in the publisher&rsquo;s own
way, the publisher&rsquo;s tale of an apple and a pear.</p>
<p>I at first felt much inclined to be of the publisher&rsquo;s
opinion with respect to the theory of the pear.&nbsp; After all,
why should the earth be shaped like an apple, and not like a
pear?&mdash;it would certainly gain in appearance by being shaped
like a pear.&nbsp; A pear being a handsomer fruit than an apple,
the publisher is probably right, thought I, and I will say that
he is right on this point in the notice which I am about to write
of his publication for the Review.&nbsp; And yet I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;said I, after a long fit of musing&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know but what there is more to be said for the Oxford
theory.&nbsp; The world may be shaped like a pear, but I
don&rsquo;t know that it is; but one thing I know, which is, that
it does not taste like a pear; I have always liked pears, but I
don&rsquo;t like the world.&nbsp; The world to me tastes much
more like an apple, and I have never liked apples.&nbsp; I will
uphold the Oxford theory&mdash;besides, I am writing in an
&ldquo;Oxford Review&rdquo;&mdash;and am in duty bound to uphold
the Oxford theory.&nbsp; So in <!-- page 319--><a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>my notice I
asserted that the world was round; I quoted Scripture, and
endeavoured to prove that the world was typified by the apple in
Scripture, both as to shape and properties.&nbsp; &ldquo;An apple
is round,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the world is round&mdash;the
apple is a sour, disagreeable fruit; and who has tasted much of
the world without having his teeth set on edge?&rdquo;&nbsp; I,
however, treated the publisher, upon the whole, in the most
urbane and Oxford-like manner; complimenting him upon his style,
acknowledging the general soundness of his views, and only
differing with him in the affair of the apple and pear.</p>
<p>I did not like reviewing at all&mdash;it was not to my taste;
it was not in my way; I liked it far less than translating the
publisher&rsquo;s philosophy, for that was something in the line
of one whom a competent judge had surnamed Lavengro.&nbsp; I
never could understand why Reviews were instituted; works of
merit do not require to be reviewed, they can speak for
themselves, and require no praising; works of no merit at all
will die of themselves, they require no killing.&nbsp; The Review
to which I was attached was, as has been already intimated,
established on an entirely new plan; it professed to review all
new publications, which certainly no Review had ever professed to
do before, other Reviews never pretending to review more than
one-tenth of the current literature of the day.&nbsp; When I say
it professed to review all new publications, I should add, which
should be sent to it; for, of course, the Review would not
acknowledge the existence of publications, the authors of which
did not acknowledge the existence of the Review.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think, however, that the Review had much cause to
<!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>complain of being neglected; I have reason to believe
that at least nine-tenths of the publications of the day were
sent to the Review, and in due time reviewed.&nbsp; I had good
opportunity of judging&mdash;I was connected with several
departments of the Review, though more particularly with the
poetical and philosophic ones.&nbsp; An English translation of
Kant&rsquo;s philosophy made its appearance on my table the day
before its publication.&nbsp; In my notice of this work, I said
that the English shortly hoped to give the Germans a <i>quid pro
quo</i>.&nbsp; I believe at that time authors were much in the
habit of publishing at their own expense.&nbsp; All the poetry
which I reviewed appeared to be published at the expense of the
authors.&nbsp; If I am asked how I comported myself, under all
circumstances, as a reviewer&mdash;I answer,&mdash;I did not
forget that I was connected with a Review established on Oxford
principles, the editor of which had translated Quintilian.&nbsp;
All the publications which fell under my notice I treated in a
gentlemanly and Oxford-like manner, no personalities&mdash;no
vituperation&mdash;no shabby insinuations; decorum, decorum was
the order of the day.&nbsp; Occasionally a word of admonition,
but gently expressed, as an Oxford undergraduate might have
expressed it, or master of arts.&nbsp; How the authors whose
publications were consigned to my colleagues were treated by them
I know not; I suppose they were treated in an urbane and
Oxford-like manner, but I cannot say; I did not read the
reviewals of my colleagues, I did not read my own after they were
printed.&nbsp; I did not like reviewing.</p>
<p>Of all my occupations at this period I am free to confess I
liked that of compiling the &ldquo;Newgate <!-- page 321--><a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>Lives and
Trials&rdquo; the best; that is, after I had surmounted a kind of
prejudice which I originally entertained.&nbsp; The trials were
entertaining enough; but the lives&mdash;how full were they of
wild and racy adventures, and in what racy, genuine language were
they told.&nbsp; What struck me most with respect to these lives
was the art which the writers, whoever they were, possessed of
telling a plain story.&nbsp; It is no easy thing to tell a story
plainly and distinctly by mouth; but to tell one on paper is
difficult indeed, so many snares lie in the way.&nbsp; People are
afraid to put down what is common on paper; they seek to
embellish their narratives, as they think, by philosophic
speculations and reflections; they are anxious to shine, and
people who are anxious to shine can never tell a plain
story.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I went with them to a music booth, where
they made me almost drunk with gin, and began to talk their flash
language, which I did not understand,&rdquo; says, or is made to
say, Henry Simms, executed at Tyburn some seventy years before
the time of which I am speaking.&nbsp; I have always looked upon
this sentence as a masterpiece of the narrative style, it is so
concise and yet so very clear.&nbsp; As I gazed on passages like
this, and there were many nearly as good in the Newgate Lives, I
often sighed that it was not my fortune to have to render these
lives into German rather than the publisher&rsquo;s
philosophy&mdash;his tale of an apple and pear.</p>
<p>Mine was an ill-regulated mind at this period.&nbsp; As I read
over the lives of these robbers and pickpockets, strange doubts
began to arise in my mind about virtue and crime.&nbsp; Years
before, when quite a boy, as in one of the early chapters I have
hinted, I had been a necessitarian; I had even written an <!--
page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>essay on crime (I have it now before me, penned in a
round boyish hand), in which I attempted to prove that there is
no such thing as crime or virtue, all our actions being the
result of circumstances or necessity.&nbsp; These doubts were now
again reviving in my mind; I could not, for the life of me,
imagine how, taking all circumstances into consideration, these
highwaymen, these pickpockets, should have been anything else
than highwaymen and pickpockets; any more than how, taking all
circumstances into consideration, Bishop Latimer (the reader is
aware that I had read &ldquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs&rdquo;)
should have been anything else than Bishop Latimer.&nbsp; I had a
very ill-regulated mind at that period.</p>
<p>My own peculiar ideas with respect to everything being a lying
dream began also to revive.&nbsp; Sometimes at midnight, after
having toiled for hours at my occupations, I would fling myself
back on my chair, look about the poor apartment, dimly lighted by
an unsnuffed candle, or upon the heaps of books and papers before
me, and exclaim,&mdash;&ldquo;Do I exist?&nbsp; Do these things,
which I think I see about me, exist, or do they not?&nbsp; Is not
every thing a dream&mdash;a deceitful dream?&nbsp; Is not this
apartment a dream&mdash;the furniture a dream?&nbsp; The
publisher a dream&mdash;his philosophy a dream?&nbsp; Am I not
myself a dream&mdash;dreaming about translating a dream?&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t see why all should not be a dream; what&rsquo;s the
use of the reality?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then I would pinch myself,
and snuff the burdened smoky light.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see, for the life of me, the use of all this; therefore why
should I think that it exists?&nbsp; If there was a chance, a
probability of all this tending to anything, I might believe; but
. . . &rdquo; and then <!-- page 323--><a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>I would
stare and think, and after some time shake my head and return
again to my occupations for an hour or two; and then I would
perhaps shake, and shiver, and yawn, and look wistfully in the
direction of my sleeping apartment; and then, but not wistfully,
at the papers and books before me; and sometimes I would return
to my papers and books; but oftener I would arise, and, after
another yawn and shiver, take my light, and proceed to my
sleeping chamber.</p>
<p>They say that light fare begets light dreams; my fare at that
time was light enough; but I had anything but light dreams, for
at that period I had all kind of strange and extravagant dreams,
and amongst other things I dreamt that the whole world had taken
to dog-fighting; and that I, myself, had taken to dog-fighting,
and that in a vast circus I backed an English bulldog against the
bloodhound of the Pope of Rome.</p>

<p>My Brother&mdash;Fits of Crying&mdash;Mayor Elect&mdash;The
Committee&mdash;The Norman Arch&mdash;A Word of
Greek&mdash;Church and State&mdash;At My Own Expense&mdash;If You
Please.</p>
<p>One morning <a name="citation324"></a><a href="#footnote324"
class="citation">[324]</a> I arose somewhat later than usual,
having been occupied during the greater part of the night with my
literary toil.&nbsp; On descending from my chamber into the
sitting-room I found a person seated by the fire, whose glance
was directed sideways to the table, on which were the usual
preparations for my morning&rsquo;s meal.&nbsp; Forthwith I gave
a cry, and sprang forward to embrace the person; for the person
by the fire, whose glance was directed to the table, was no one
else than my brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how are things going on at home?&rdquo; said I to
my brother, after we had kissed and embraced.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is
my mother, and how is the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, thank God, is tolerably well,&rdquo; said my
brother, &ldquo;but very much given to fits of crying.&nbsp; As
for the dog, he is not so well; but we will talk more of these
matters anon,&rdquo; said my brother, again glancing at the
breakfast things: &ldquo;I <!-- page 325--><a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>am very
hungry, as you may suppose, after having travelled all
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I exerted myself to the best of my ability to
perform the duties of hospitality, and I made my brother
welcome&mdash;I may say more than welcome; and, when the rage of
my brother&rsquo;s hunger was somewhat abated, we recommenced
talking about the matters of our little family, and my brother
told me much about my mother; he spoke of her fits of crying, but
said that of late the said fits of crying had much diminished,
and she appeared to be taking comfort; and, if I am not much
mistaken, my brother told me that my mother had of late the
Prayer-book frequently in her hand, and yet oftener the
Bible.</p>
<p>We were silent for a time&mdash;at last I opened my mouth and
mentioned the dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog,&rdquo; said my brother, &ldquo;is, I am
afraid, in a very poor way; ever since the death he has done
nothing but pine and take on.&nbsp; A few months ago, you
remember, he was as plump and fine as any dog in the town; but at
present he is little more than skin and bone.&nbsp; Once we lost
him for two days, and never expected to see him again, imagining
that some mischance had befallen him; at length I found
him&mdash;where do you think?&nbsp; Chancing to pass by the
churchyard, I found him seated on the grave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but let us talk of
something else.&nbsp; It was very kind of you to come and see
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for that matter, I did not come up to see you,
though of course I am very glad to see you, having been rather
anxious about you, like my mother, who has received only one
letter from you <!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>since your departure.&nbsp; No, I
did not come up on purpose to see you; but on a quite different
account.&nbsp; You must know that the corporation of our town
have lately elected a new mayor, a person of many
qualifications&mdash;big and portly, with a voice like Boanerges;
a religious man, the possessor of an immense pew; loyal, so much
so that I once heard him say that he would at any time go three
miles to hear any one sing &lsquo;God save the King&rsquo;;
moreover, a giver of excellent dinners.&nbsp; Such is our present
mayor; <a name="citation326"></a><a href="#footnote326"
class="citation">[326]</a> who, owing to his loyalty, his
religion, and a little, perhaps, to his dinners, is a mighty
favourite; so much so that the town is anxious to have his
portrait painted in a superior style, so that remote posterity
may know what kind of man he was, the colour of his hair, his air
and gait.&nbsp; So a committee was formed some time ago, which is
still sitting; that is, they dine with the mayor every day to
talk over the subject.&nbsp; A few days since, to my great
surprise, they made their appearance in my poor studio, and
desired to be favoured with a sight of some of my paintings;
well, I showed them some, and, after looking at them with great
attention, they went aside and whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; I heard one say; &lsquo;Yes,
he&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; said another; and then they came to me,
and one of them, a little man with a hump on his back, who is a
watchmaker, assumed the office of spokesman, and made a long
speech&mdash;(the old town has been always celebrated for
orators)&mdash;in which he told me how much they had been pleased
with my productions&mdash;(the old town has been always
celebrated for its artistic taste)&mdash;and, what do you think?
offered <!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>me the painting of the mayor&rsquo;s
portrait, and a hundred pounds for my trouble.&nbsp; Well, of
course I was much surprised, and for a minute or two could
scarcely speak; recovering myself, however, I made a speech, not
so eloquent as that of the watchmaker of course, being not so
accustomed to speaking; but not so bad either, taking everything
into consideration, telling them how flattered I felt by the
honour which they had conferred in proposing to me such an
undertaking; expressing, however, my fears that I was not
competent to the task, and concluding by saying what a pity it
was that Crome was dead.&nbsp; &lsquo;Crome,&rsquo; said the
little man, &lsquo;Crome; yes, he was a clever man, a very clever
man in his way; he was good at painting landscapes and
farmhouses, but he would not do in the present instance were he
alive.&nbsp; He had no conception of the heroic, sir.&nbsp; We
want some person capable of representing our mayor striding under
the Norman arch out of the cathedral.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the mention
of the heroic an idea came at once into my head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you are in quest of the
heroic, I am glad that you came to me; don&rsquo;t mistake
me,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;I do not mean to say that I could
do justice to your subject, though I am fond of the heroic; but I
can introduce you to a great master of the heroic, fully
competent to do justice to your mayor.&nbsp; Not to me,
therefore, be the painting of the picture given, but to a friend
of mine, the great master of the heroic, to the best, the
strongest, &tau;&omega;
&kappa;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omega;,&rsquo; I
added, for, being amongst orators, I thought a word of Greek
would tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and what did the orators
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>&ldquo;They gazed dubiously at me and at one
another,&rdquo; said my brother; &ldquo;at last the watchmaker
asked me who this Mr. Christo was; adding, that he had never
heard of such a person; that, from my recommendation of him, he
had no doubt that he was a very clever man; but that they should
like to know something more about him before giving the
commission to him.&nbsp; That he had heard of Christie the great
auctioneer, who was considered to be an excellent judge of
pictures; but he supposed that I scarcely&mdash;Whereupon,
interrupting the watchmaker, I told him that I alluded neither to
Christo nor to Christie; but to the painter of Lazarus rising
from the grave, a painter under whom I had myself studied during
some months that I had spent in London, and to whom I was
indebted for much connected with the heroic. <a
name="citation328"></a><a href="#footnote328"
class="citation">[328]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have heard of him,&rsquo; said the watchmaker,
&lsquo;and his paintings too; but I am afraid that he is not
exactly the gentleman by whom our mayor would wish to be
painted.&nbsp; I have heard say that he is not a very good friend
to Church and State.&nbsp; Come, young man,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;it appears to me that you are too modest; I like your
style of painting, so do we all, and&mdash;why should I mince the
matter?&mdash;the money is to be collected in the town, why
should it go into a stranger&rsquo;s pocket, and be spent in
London?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon I made them a speech, in which I said that
art had nothing to do with Church and State, at least with
English Church and State, which had never encouraged it; and
that, though <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 329</span>Church and State were doubtless very
fine things, a man might be a very good artist who cared not a
straw for either.&nbsp; I then made use of some more Greek words,
and told them how painting was one of the Nine Muses, and one of
the most independent creatures alive, inspiring whom she pleased,
and asking leave of nobody; that I should be quite unworthy of
the favours of the Muse if, on the present occasion, I did not
recommend them a man whom I considered to be a much greater
master of the heroic than myself; and that, with regard to the
money being spent in the city, I had no doubt that they would not
weigh for a moment such a consideration against the chance of
getting a true heroic picture for the city.&nbsp; I never talked
so well in my life, and said so many flattering things to the
hunchback and his friends, that at last they said that I should
have my own way; and that if I pleased to go up to London, and
bring down the painter of Lazarus to paint the mayor, I might; so
they then bade me farewell, and I have come up to
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put a hundred pounds into the hands
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better man than myself,&rdquo; said my brother,
&ldquo;of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you come up at your own expense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my brother, &ldquo;I have come up at
my own expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no answer, but looked in my brother&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
We then returned to the former subjects of conversation, talking
of the dead, my mother, and the dog.</p>
<p>After some time, my brother said, &ldquo;I will now go to the
painter, and communicate to <!-- page 330--><a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>him the
business which has brought me to town; and, if you please, I will
take you with me and introduce you to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having
expressed my willingness, we descended into the street.</p>

<p>Painter of the Heroic&mdash;I&rsquo;ll Go!&mdash;A Modest
Peep&mdash;Who is This?&mdash;A Capital
Pharaoh&mdash;Disproportionably Short&mdash;Imaginary
Picture&mdash;English Figures.</p>
<p>The painter of the heroic resided a great way off, at the
western end of the town.&nbsp; We had some difficulty in
obtaining admission to him; a maid-servant, who opened the door,
eyeing us somewhat suspiciously: it was not until my brother had
said that he was a friend of the painter that we were permitted
to pass the threshold.&nbsp; At length we were shown into the
studio, where we found the painter, with an easel and brush,
standing before a huge piece of canvas, on which he had lately
commenced painting a heroic picture.&nbsp; The painter might be
about thirty-five years old; he had a clever, intelligent
countenance, with a sharp grey eye&mdash;his hair was dark brown,
and cut &agrave;-la-Rafael, as I was subsequently told, that is,
there was little before and much behind&mdash;he did not wear a
neckcloth; but, in its stead, a black riband, so that his neck,
which was rather fine, was somewhat exposed&mdash;he had a broad
muscular breast, and I make no doubt that he would have been a
very fine figure, but unfortunately his legs and thighs were
somewhat short.&nbsp; He <!-- page 332--><a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>recognised
my brother, and appeared glad to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you to London?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Whereupon my brother gave him a brief account of his
commission.&nbsp; At the mention of the hundred pounds, I
observed the eyes of the painter glisten.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said he, when my brother had concluded,
&ldquo;it was very kind to think of me.&nbsp; I am not very fond
of painting portraits; but a mayor is a mayor, and there is
something grand in that idea of the Norman arch.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go; moreover, I am just at this moment confoundedly in need of
money, and when you knocked at the door, I don&rsquo;t mind
telling you, I thought it was some dun.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
how it is, but in the capital they have no taste for the heroic,
they will scarce look at a heroic picture; I am glad to hear that
they have better taste in the provinces.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go;
when shall we set off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon it was arranged between the painter and my brother
that they should depart the next day but one; they then began to
talk of art.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to the heroic,&rdquo;
said the painter; &ldquo;I now and then dabble in the comic, but
what I do gives me no pleasure, the comic is so low; there is
nothing like the heroic.&nbsp; I am engaged here on a heroic
picture,&rdquo; said he, pointing to the canvas; &ldquo;the
subject is &lsquo;Pharaoh dismissing Moses from Egypt,&rsquo;
after the last plague&mdash;the death of the first-born;&mdash;it
is not far advanced&mdash;that finished figure is Moses:&rdquo;
they both looked at the canvas, and I, standing behind, took a
modest peep.&nbsp; The picture, as the painter said, was not far
advanced, the Pharaoh was merely in outline; my eye was, of
course, attracted by the finished figure, or rather <!-- page
333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>what the painter had called the finished figure; but,
as I gazed upon it, it appeared to me that there was something
defective&mdash;something unsatisfactory in the figure.&nbsp; I
concluded, however, that the painter, notwithstanding what he had
said, had omitted to give it the finishing touch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
intend this to be my best picture,&rdquo; said the painter;
&ldquo;what I want now is a face for Pharaoh; I have long been
meditating on a face for Pharaoh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, chancing to
cast his eye upon my countenance, of whom he had scarcely taken
any manner of notice, he remained with his mouth open for some
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; said he at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, this is my brother; I forgot to introduce him . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We presently afterwards departed; my brother talked much about
the painter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a noble fellow,&rdquo; said my
brother; &ldquo;but, like many other noble fellows, has a great
many enemies; he is hated by his brethren of the brush&mdash;all
the land and waterscape painters hate him&mdash;but, above all,
the race of portrait painters, who are ten times more numerous
than the other two sorts, detest him for his heroic
tendencies.&nbsp; It will be a kind of triumph to the last, I
fear, when they hear he has condescended to paint a portrait;
however, that Norman arch will enable him to escape from their
malice&mdash;that is a capital idea of the watchmaker, that
Norman arch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spent a happy day with my brother.&nbsp; On the morrow he
went again to the painter, with whom he dined; I did not go with
him.&nbsp; On his return he said, &ldquo;The painter has been
asking a great many questions about you, and expressed a wish
that you would sit to him as Pharaoh; he thinks you would make a
capital Pharaoh.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no <!-- page 334--><a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>wish to
appear on canvas,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;moreover he can find much
better Pharaohs than myself; and, if he wants a real Pharaoh,
there is a certain Mr. Petulengro.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Petulengro?&rdquo; said my brother; &ldquo;a strange kind
of fellow came up to me some time ago in our town, and asked me
about you; when I inquired his name, he told me Petulengro.&nbsp;
No, he will not do, he is too short; by the bye, do you not think
that figure of Moses is somewhat short?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then it
appeared to me that I had thought the figure of Moses somewhat
short, and I told my brother so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my
brother.</p>
<p>On the morrow my brother departed with the painter for the old
town, and there the painter painted the mayor.&nbsp; I did not
see the picture for a great many years, when, chancing to be at
the old town, I beheld it.</p>
<p>The original mayor was a mighty, portly man, with a
bull&rsquo;s head, black hair, body like that of a dray horse,
and legs and thighs corresponding; a man six foot high at the
least.&nbsp; To his bull&rsquo;s head, black hair, and body the
painter had done justice; there was one point, however, in which
the portrait did not correspond with the original&mdash;the legs
were disproportionably short, the painter having substituted his
own legs for those of the mayor, which when I perceived I
rejoiced that I had not consented to be painted as Pharaoh, for,
if I had, the chances are that he would have served me in exactly
a similar way as he had served Moses and the mayor.</p>
<p>Short legs in a heroic picture will never do; and, upon the
whole, I think the painter&rsquo;s attempt at the heroic in
painting the mayor of the old town a decided failure.&nbsp; If I
am now asked whether the <!-- page 335--><a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>picture
would have been a heroic one provided the painter had not
substituted his own legs for those of the mayor&mdash;I must say,
I am afraid not.&nbsp; I have no idea of making heroic pictures
out of English mayors, even with the assistance of Norman arches;
yet I am sure that capital pictures might be made out of English
mayors, not issuing from Norman arches, but rather from the door
of the &ldquo;Checquers&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Brewers
Three.&rdquo;&nbsp; The painter in question had great comic
power, which he scarcely ever cultivated; he would fain be a
Rafael, which he never could be, when he might have been
something quite as good&mdash;another Hogarth; the only comic
piece which he ever presented to the world being something little
inferior to the best of that illustrious master.&nbsp; I have
often thought what a capital picture might have been made by my
brother&rsquo;s friend, if, instead of making the mayor issue out
of the Norman arch, he had painted him moving under the sign of
the &ldquo;Checquers,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Three Brewers,&rdquo;
with mace&mdash;yes, with mace,&mdash;the mace appears in the
picture issuing out of the Norman arch behind the
mayor,&mdash;but likewise with Snap, and with whiffler, quart
pot, and frying pan, Billy Blind, and Owlenglass, Mr. Petulengro,
and Pakomovna;&mdash;then, had he clapped his own legs upon the
mayor, or any one else in the concourse, what matter?&nbsp; But I
repeat that I have no hope of making heroic pictures out of
English mayors, or, indeed, out of English figures in
general.&nbsp; England may be a land of heroic hearts, but it is
not, properly, a land of heroic figures, or heroic
posture-making.&mdash;Italy . . . what was I going to say about
Italy? <a name="citation335"></a><a href="#footnote335"

Hearse&mdash;Mortal Relics&mdash;Great Poet&mdash;Fashion and
Fame&mdash;What a Difference!&mdash;Oh, Beautiful!&mdash;Good for
Nothing.</p>
<p>And now once more to my pursuits, to my Lives and
Trials.&nbsp; However partial at first I might be to these Lives
and Trials, it was not long before they became regular trials to
me, owing to the whims and caprices of the publisher.&nbsp; I had
not been long connected with him before I discovered that he was
wonderfully fond of interfering with other people&rsquo;s
business&mdash;at least with the business of those who were under
his control.&nbsp; What a life did his unfortunate authors
lead!&nbsp; He had many in his employ toiling at all kinds of
subjects&mdash;I call them authors because there is something
respectable in the term author, though they had little authorship
in, and no authority whatever over, the works on which they were
engaged.&nbsp; It is true the publisher interfered with some
colour of reason, the plan of all and every of the works alluded
to having originated with himself; and, be it observed, many of
his plans were highly clever and promising, for, as I have
already <!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 337</span>had occasion to say, the publisher
in many points was a highly clever and sagacious person; but he
ought to have been contented with planning the works originally,
and have left to other people the task of executing them, instead
of which he marred everything by his rage for interference.&nbsp;
If a book of fairy tales was being compiled, he was sure to
introduce some of his philosophy, explaining the fairy tale by
some theory of his own.&nbsp; Was a book of anecdotes on hand, it
was sure to be half filled with sayings and doings of himself
during the time that he was common councilman of the City of
London.&nbsp; Now, however fond the public might be of fairy
tales, it by no means relished them in conjunction with the
publisher&rsquo;s philosophy; and however fond of anecdotes in
general, or even of the publisher in particular&mdash;for indeed
there were a great many anecdotes in circulation about him which
the public both read and listened to very readily&mdash;it took
no pleasure in such anecdotes as he was disposed to relate about
himself.&nbsp; In the compilation of my Lives and Trials, I was
exposed to incredible mortification, and ceaseless trouble, from
this same rage for interference.&nbsp; It is true he could not
introduce his philosophy into the work, nor was it possible for
him to introduce anecdotes of himself, having never had the good
or evil fortune to be tried at the bar; but he was continually
introducing&mdash;what, under a less apathetic government than
the one then being, would have infallibly subjected him, and
perhaps myself, to a trial,&mdash;his politics; not his Oxford or
pseudo politics, but the politics which he really entertained,
and which were of the most republican and violent kind.&nbsp; But
this was not all; when about a moiety of the first <!-- page
338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>volume had been printed, he materially altered the plan
of the work; it was no longer to be a collection of mere Newgate
lives and trials, but of lives and trials of criminals in
general, foreign as well as domestic.&nbsp; In a little time the
work became a wondrous farrago, in which K&ouml;nigsmark the
robber figured by the side of Sam Lynn, and the Marchioness de
Brinvilliers was placed in contact with a Chinese outlaw.&nbsp;
What gave me the most trouble and annoyance was the
publisher&rsquo;s remembering some life or trial, foreign or
domestic, which he wished to be inserted, and which I was
forthwith to go in quest of and purchase at my own expense: some
of those lives and trials were by no means easy to find.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where is Brandt and Struensee?&rdquo; cries the publisher;
&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied; whereupon
the publisher falls to squealing like one of Joey&rsquo;s
rats.&nbsp; &ldquo;Find me up Brandt and Struensee by next
morning, or . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you found Brandt and
Struensee?&rdquo; cried the publisher, on my appearing before him
next morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;I can hear
nothing about them;&rdquo; whereupon the publisher falls to
bellowing like Joey&rsquo;s bull.&nbsp; By dint of incredible
diligence, I at length discover the dingy volume containing the
lives and trials of the celebrated two who had brooded treason
dangerous to the state of Denmark.&nbsp; I purchase the dingy
volume, and bring it in triumph to the publisher, the
perspiration running down my brow.&nbsp; The publisher takes the
dingy volume in his hand, he examines it attentively, then puts
it down; his countenance is calm for a moment, almost
benign.&nbsp; Another moment and there is a gleam in the
publisher&rsquo;s sinister eye; he snatches up the paper <!--
page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>containing the names of the worthies which I have
intended shall figure in the forthcoming volumes&mdash;he glances
rapidly over it, and his countenance once more assumes a terrific
expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; he exclaims;
&ldquo;I can scarcely believe my eyes&mdash;the most important
life and trial omitted to be found in the whole criminal
record&mdash;what gross, what utter negligence!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the life of Farmer Patch? where&rsquo;s the trial
of Yeoman Patch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a life! what a dog&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; I would
frequently exclaim, after escaping from the presence of the
publisher.</p>
<p>One day, after a scene with the publisher similar to that
which I have described above, I found myself about noon at the
bottom of Oxford Street, where it forms a right angle with the
road which leads or did lead to Tottenham Court.&nbsp; Happening
to cast my eyes around, it suddenly occurred to me that something
uncommon was expected; people were standing in groups on the
pavement&mdash;the upstair windows of the houses were thronged
with faces, especially those of women, and many of the shops were
partly, and not a few entirely closed.&nbsp; What could be the
reason of all this?&nbsp; All at once I bethought me that this
street of Oxford was no other than the far-famed Tyburn
way.&nbsp; Oh, oh, thought I, an execution; some handsome young
robber is about to be executed at the farther end; just so, see
how earnestly the women are peering; perhaps another Harry
Symms&mdash;Gentleman Harry as they called him&mdash;is about to
be carted along this street to Tyburn tree; but then I remembered
that Tyburn tree had long since been cut down, and that
criminals, whether young or old, good-looking or ugly, were <!--
page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>executed before the big stone gaol, which I had looked
at with a kind of shudder during my short rambles in the
city.&nbsp; What could be the matter?&nbsp; Just then I heard
various voices cry &ldquo;There it comes!&rdquo; and all heads
were turned up Oxford Street, down which a hearse was slowly
coming: nearer and nearer it drew; presently it was just opposite
the place where I was standing, when, turning to the left, it
proceeded slowly along Tottenham Road; immediately behind the
hearse were three or four mourning coaches, full of people, some
of which, from the partial glimpse which I caught of them,
appeared to be foreigners; behind these came a very long train of
splendid carriages, all of which, without one exception, were
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose body is in that hearse?&rdquo; said I to a
dapper-looking individual, seemingly a shopkeeper, who stood
beside me on the pavement, looking at the procession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mortal relics of Lord Byron,&rdquo; said the
dapper-looking individual, mouthing his words and
smirking&mdash;&ldquo;the illustrious poet, which have been just
brought from Greece, and are being conveyed to the family vault
in ---shire.&rdquo; <a name="citation340"></a><a
href="#footnote340" class="citation">[340]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;An illustrious poet, was he?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond all criticism,&rdquo; said the dapper man;
&ldquo;all we of the rising generation are under incalculable
obligation to Byron; I myself, in particular, have reason to say
so; in all my correspondence my style is formed on the Byronic
model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the individual for a moment, who <!-- page
341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>smiled and smirked to himself applause, and then I
turned my eyes upon the hearse proceeding slowly up the almost
endless street.&nbsp; This man, this Byron, had for many years
past been the demigod of England, and his verses the daily food
of those who read, from the peer to the draper&rsquo;s assistant;
all were admirers, or rather worshippers, of Byron, and all
doated on his verses; and then I thought of those who, with
genius as high as his, or higher, had lived and died
neglected.&nbsp; I thought of Milton abandoned to poverty and
blindness; of witty and ingenious Butler consigned to the tender
mercies of bailiffs; and starving Otway: they had lived neglected
and despised, and, when they died, a few poor mourners only had
followed them to the grave; but this Byron had been made a half
god of when living, and now that he was dead he was followed by
worshipping crowds, and the very sun seemed to come out on
purpose to grace his funeral.&nbsp; And, indeed, the sun, which
for many days past had hidden its face in clouds, shone out that
morn with wonderful brilliancy, flaming upon the black hearse and
its tall ostrich plumes, the mourning coaches, and the long train
of aristocratic carriages which followed behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great poet, sir,&rdquo; said the dapper-looking man,
&ldquo;great poet, but unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unhappy? yes, I had heard that he had been unhappy; that he
had roamed about a fevered, distempered man, taking pleasure in
nothing&mdash;that I had heard; but was it true? was he really
unhappy? was not this unhappiness assumed, with the view of
increasing the interest which the world took in him? and yet who
could say?&nbsp; He might be unhappy, and with reason.&nbsp; Was
he a real poet <!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>after all? might he not doubt
himself? might he not have a lurking consciousness that he was
undeserving of the homage which he was receiving? that it could
not last? that he was rather at the top of fashion than of
fame?&nbsp; He was a lordling, a glittering, gorgeous lordling:
and he might have had a consciousness that he owed much of his
celebrity to being so; he might have felt that he was rather at
the top of fashion than of fame.&nbsp; Fashion soon changes,
thought I, eagerly to myself&mdash;a time will come, and that
speedily, when he will be no longer in the fashion; when this
idiotic admirer of his, who is still grinning at my side, shall
have ceased to mould his style on Byron&rsquo;s; and this
aristocracy, squirearchy, and what not, who now send their empty
carriages to pay respect to the fashionable corpse, shall have
transferred their empty worship to some other animate or
inanimate thing.&nbsp; Well, perhaps after all it was better to
have been mighty Milton in his poverty and blindness&mdash;witty
and ingenious Butler consigned to the tender mercies of bailiffs,
and starving Otway; they might enjoy more real pleasure than this
lordling; they must have been aware that the world would one day
do them justice&mdash;fame after death is better than the top of
fashion in life.&nbsp; They have left a fame behind them which
shall never die, whilst this lordling&mdash;a time will come when
he will be out of fashion and forgotten.&nbsp; And yet I
don&rsquo;t know; didn&rsquo;t he write Childe Harold and that
ode?&nbsp; Yes, he wrote Childe Harold and that ode.&nbsp; Then a
time will scarcely come when he will be forgotten.&nbsp; Lords,
squires, and cockneys may pass away, but a time will scarcely
come when Childe Harold and that ode will be forgotten.&nbsp; He
<!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>was a poet, after all, and he must have known it; a
real poet, equal to . . . to . . . what a destiny!&nbsp; Rank,
beauty, fashion, immortality,&mdash;he could not be unhappy; what
a difference in the fate of men!&nbsp; I wish I could think he
was unhappy . . .</p>
<p>I turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great poet, sir,&rdquo; said the dapper man, turning
away too, &ldquo;but unhappy&mdash;fate of genius, sir; I, too,
am frequently unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurrying down a street to the right, I encountered Francis
Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means the multitude yonder?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are looking after the hearse which is carrying the
remains of Byron up Tottenham Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the man,&rdquo; said my friend, as he
turned back the way he had come, &ldquo;so I can dispense with
seeing the hearse&mdash;I saw the living man at Venice&mdash;ah,
a great poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a great poet, it must be so,
everybody says so&mdash;what a destiny!&nbsp; What a difference
in the fate of men! but &rsquo;tis said he was unhappy; you have
seen him, how did he look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did he look happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t say he looked very unhappy; I saw
him with two . . . very fair ladies; but what is it to you
whether the man was unhappy or not?&nbsp; Come, where shall we
go&mdash;to Joey&rsquo;s?&nbsp; His hugest bear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have had enough of bears; I have just been
worried by one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The publisher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>&ldquo;Then come to Joey&rsquo;s, three dogs are to be
launched at his bear: as they pin him, imagine him to be the
publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am good for nothing; I
think I shall stroll to London Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too far for me&mdash;farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>London Bridge&mdash;Why Not?&mdash;Every Heart has its
Bitters&mdash;Wicked Boys&mdash;Give me my Book&mdash;Such a
Fright&mdash;Honour Bright.</p>
<p>So I went to London Bridge, and again took my station on the
spot by the booth where I had stood on the former occasion.&nbsp;
The booth, however, was empty; neither the apple-woman nor her
stall was to be seen.&nbsp; I looked over the balustrade upon the
river; the tide was now, as before, rolling beneath the arch with
frightful impetuosity.&nbsp; As I gazed upon the eddies of the
whirlpool, I thought within myself how soon human life would
become extinct there; a plunge, a convulsive flounder, and all
would be over.&nbsp; When I last stood over that abyss I had felt
a kind of impulse&mdash;a fascination; I had resisted it&mdash;I
did not plunge into it.&nbsp; At present I felt a kind of impulse
to plunge; but the impulse was of a different kind; it proceeded
from a loathing of life.&nbsp; I looked wistfully at the
eddies&mdash;what had I to live for?&mdash;what indeed!&nbsp; I
thought of Brandt and Struensee, and Yeoman Patch&mdash;should I
yield to the impulse&mdash;why not?&nbsp; My eyes were fixed on
the eddies.&nbsp; All of a sudden I shuddered; I thought I saw
heads in the pool; human bodies <!-- page 346--><a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>wallowing
confusedly; eyes turned up to heaven with hopeless horror; was
that water, or . . . Where was the impulse now?&nbsp; I raised my
eyes from the pool, I looked no more upon it&mdash;I looked
forward, far down the stream in the far distance.&nbsp; Ha! what
is that?&nbsp; I thought I saw a kind of Fata Morgana, green
meadows, waving groves, a rustic home; but in the far
distance&mdash;I stared&mdash;I stared&mdash;a Fata
Morgana&mdash;it was gone . . .</p>
<p>I left the balustrade and walked to the farther end of the
bridge, where I stood for some time contemplating the crowd; I
then passed over to the other side with an intention of returning
home; just half way over the bridge, in a booth immediately
opposite to the one in which I had formerly beheld her, sat my
friend, the old apple-woman, huddled up behind her stall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how are
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old woman lifted her head with a startled
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I do.&nbsp; Ah, yes,&rdquo; said she, as
her features beamed with recollection, &ldquo;I know you, dear;
you are the young lad that gave me the tanner.&nbsp; Well, child,
got anything to sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;bad enough, and ill
usage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I suppose they caught ye; well, child, never mind,
better luck next time; I am glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, sitting down on the stone
bench; &ldquo;I thought you had left the bridge&mdash;why have
you changed your side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman shook.</p>
<p><!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>&ldquo;What is the matter with you,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child, no; only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what?&nbsp; Any bad news of your son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child, no; nothing about my son.&nbsp; Only low,
child&mdash;every heart has its bitters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;well, I
don&rsquo;t want to know your sorrows; come, where&rsquo;s the
book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apple-woman shook more violently than before, bent herself
down, and drew her cloak more closely about her than
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Book, child, what book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, blessed Mary, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that; I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got it, child&mdash;I
have lost it, have left it at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;left it at
home&mdash;what do you mean?&nbsp; Come, let me have
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got it, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you have got it under your cloak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell any one, dear;
don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and the apple-woman burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said I,
staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to take my book from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I; I care nothing about it; keep it, if you like,
only tell me what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all about that book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they wanted to take it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, some wicked boys.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you all
about it.&nbsp; Eight or ten days ago, I sat behind my stall,
reading my book; all of a sudden I felt it snatched from my hand;
up I started, and see three rascals of boys grinning at me; one
of them <!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>held the book in his hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What book is this?&rsquo; said he, grinning at it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you want with my book?&rsquo; said I, clutching at
it over my stall; &lsquo;give me my book.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you want a book for?&rsquo; said he, holding it
back; &lsquo;I have a good mind to fling it into the
Thames.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me my book,&rsquo; I shrieked;
and, snatching at it, I fell over my stall, and all my fruit was
scattered about.&nbsp; Off ran the boys&mdash;off ran the rascal
with my book.&nbsp; Oh dear, I thought I should have died; up I
got, however, and ran after them as well as I could; I thought of
my fruit, but I thought more of my book.&nbsp; I left my fruit
and ran after my book.&nbsp; &lsquo;My book! my book!&rsquo; I
shrieked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Murder! theft! robbery!&rsquo;&nbsp; I was
near being crushed under the wheels of a cart; but I didn&rsquo;t
care&mdash;I followed the rascals.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop them! stop
them!&rsquo;&nbsp; I ran nearly as fast as they&mdash;they
couldn&rsquo;t run very fast on account of the crowd.&nbsp; At
last some one stopped the rascal, whereupon he turned round, and
flinging the book at me, it fell into the mud; well, I picked it
up and kissed it, all muddy as it was.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has he robbed
you?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Robbed me, indeed; why, he
had got my book.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, your book,&rsquo; said
the man, and laughed, and let the rascal go.&nbsp; Ah, he might
laugh, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart beats so.&nbsp; Well, I went back to my booth
and picked up my stall and my fruits, what I could find of
them.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t keep my stall for two days, I got
such a fright; and when I got round I couldn&rsquo;t bide the
booth where the thing had happened, so I came over to the other
side.&nbsp; Oh, the rascals, if I could but see them
hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>&ldquo;Why, for stealing my book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t dislike stealing&mdash;that
you were ready to buy things&mdash;there was your son, you
know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t like a thing of yours to be
taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s quite a different thing; what&rsquo;s
stealing handkerchiefs, and that kind of thing, to do with taking
my book! there&rsquo;s a wide difference&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, dear? well, bless your heart, I&rsquo;m glad
you do.&nbsp; Would you like to look at the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour bright?&rdquo; said the apple-woman, looking me
in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honour bright,&rdquo; said I, looking the apple-woman
in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, dear, here it is,&rdquo; said she, taking it
from under her cloak; &ldquo;read it as long as you like, only
get a little farther into the booth . . .&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t sit
so near the edge . . . you might . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went deep into the booth, and the apple-woman, bringing her
chair round, almost confronted me.&nbsp; I commenced reading the
book, and was soon engrossed by it; hours passed away; once or
twice I lifted up my eyes, the apple-woman was still confronting
me: at last my eyes began to ache, whereupon I returned the book
to the apple-woman, and, giving her another tanner, walked
away.</p>

<p>Decease of the Review&mdash;Homer Himself&mdash;Bread and

<p>Time passed away, and with it the Review, which, contrary to
the publisher&rsquo;s expectation, did not prove a successful
speculation.&nbsp; About four months after the period of its
birth it expired, as all Reviews must for which there is no
demand.&nbsp; Authors had ceased to send their publications to
it, and, consequently, to purchase it; for I have already hinted
that it was almost entirely supported by authors of a particular
class, who expected to see their publications foredoomed to
immortality in its pages.&nbsp; The behaviour of these authors
towards this unfortunate publication I can attribute to no other
cause than to a report which was industriously circulated,
namely, that the Review was low, and that to be reviewed in it
was an infallible sign that one was a low person, who could be
reviewed nowhere else.&nbsp; So authors took fright; and no
wonder, for it will never do for an author to be considered
low.&nbsp; Homer himself has never yet entirely recovered from
the injury he received by Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s remark, that
<!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>the speeches of his heroes were frequently exceedingly
low.</p>
<p>So the Review ceased, and the reviewing corps no longer
existed as such; they forthwith returned to their proper
avocations&mdash;the editor to compose tunes on his piano, and to
the task of disposing of the remaining copies of his
Quintilian&mdash;the inferior members to working for the
publisher, being to a man dependants of his; one, to composing
fairy tales; another, to collecting miracles of Popish saints;
and a third, &ldquo;Newgate Lives and Trials.&rdquo;&nbsp; Owing
to the bad success of the Review, the publisher became more
furious than ever.&nbsp; My money was growing short, and I one
day asked him to pay me for my labours in the deceased
publication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;what do you want
the money for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely to live on,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;it is very
difficult to live in this town without money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money did you bring with you to town?&rdquo;
demanded the publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some twenty or thirty pounds,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have spent it already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not entirely; but it is fast
disappearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;I believe you to
be extravagant; yes, sir, extravagant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what grounds do you suppose me to be so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the publisher, &ldquo;you eat
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I eat meat sometimes; what
should I eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bread, sir,&rdquo; said the publisher; &ldquo;bread and
cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>&ldquo;So I do, sir, when I am disposed to indulge; but
I cannot often afford it&mdash;it is very expensive to dine on
bread and cheese, especially when one is fond of cheese, as I
am.&nbsp; My last bread and cheese dinner cost me
fourteenpence.&nbsp; There is drink, sir; with bread and cheese
one must drink porter, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, eat bread&mdash;bread alone.&nbsp; As good
men as yourself have eaten bread alone; they have been glad to
get it, sir.&nbsp; If with bread and cheese you must drink
porter, sir, with bread alone you can, perhaps, drink water,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, I got paid at last for my writings in the Review,
not, it is true, in the current coin of the realm, but in certain
bills; there were two of them, one payable at twelve, and the
other at eighteen months after date.&nbsp; It was a long time
before I could turn these bills to any account; at last I found a
person who, at a discount of only thirty per cent., consented to
cash them; not, however, without sundry grimaces, and, what was
still more galling, holding, more than once, the unfortunate
papers high in air between his forefinger and thumb.&nbsp; So
ill, indeed, did I like this last action, that I felt much
inclined to snatch them away.&nbsp; I restrained myself, however,
for I remembered that it was very difficult to live without
money, and that, if the present person did not discount the
bills, I should probably find no one else that would.</p>
<p>But if the treatment which I had experienced from the
publisher, previous to making this demand upon him, was difficult
to bear, that which I subsequently underwent was far more so; his
great delight seemed to consist in causing me misery and <!--
page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>mortification; if, on former occasions, he was
continually sending me in quest of lives and trials difficult to
find, he now was continually demanding lives and trials which it
was impossible to find; the personages whom he mentioned never
having lived, nor consequently been tried.&nbsp; Moreover, some
of my best Lives and Trials which I had corrected and edited with
particular care, and on which I prided myself no little, he
caused to be cancelled after they had passed through the
press.&nbsp; Amongst these was the life of &ldquo;Gentleman
Harry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are drugs, sir,&rdquo; said the
publisher, &ldquo;drugs; that life of Harry Simms has long been
the greatest drug in the calendar&mdash;has it not,
Taggart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart made no answer save by taking a pinch of snuff.&nbsp;
The reader has, I hope, not forgotten Taggart, whom I mentioned
whilst giving an account of my first morning&rsquo;s visit to the
publisher.&nbsp; I beg Taggart&rsquo;s pardon for having been so
long silent about him; but he was a very silent man&mdash;yet
there was much in Taggart&mdash;and Taggart had always been civil
and kind to me in his peculiar way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Taggart to me one
morning, when we chanced to be alone a few days after the affair
of the cancelling, &ldquo;how do you like authorship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely call authorship the drudgery I am engaged
in,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call authorship?&rdquo; said Taggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that is, I can
scarcely express what I think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I help you out?&rdquo; said Taggart, turning
round his chair, and looking at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>&ldquo;To write something grand,&rdquo; said Taggart,
taking snuff; &ldquo;to be stared at&mdash;lifted on
people&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is something like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you write something grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Taggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there are those
ballads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those wonderful versions from Ab Gwilym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be very fond of snuff,&rdquo; said I,
looking at him angrily.</p>
<p>Taggart tapped his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you taken it long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What snuff do you take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Universal mixture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you find it of use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart tapped his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In many&mdash;there is nothing like it to get a man
through; but for snuff I should scarcely be where I am
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been long here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-and-twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and snuff brought you
through?&nbsp; Give me a pinch&mdash;pah, I don&rsquo;t like
it,&rdquo; and I sneezed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take another pinch,&rdquo; said Taggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
snuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will never do for authorship; at least for
this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>&ldquo;So I begin to think&mdash;what shall I
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking of a great work&mdash;what shall it
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I could write one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to tap,&mdash;he
did not, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would require time,&rdquo; said I, with a half
sigh.</p>
<p>Taggart tapped his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal of time; I really think that my ballads .
. .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If published, would do me credit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make
an effort, and offer them to some other publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taggart took a double quantity of snuff.</p>

<p>Francis Ardry&mdash;That Won&rsquo;t Do, Sir&mdash;Observe My
Gestures&mdash;I Think You Improve&mdash;Better than
Politics&mdash;Delightful Young Frenchwoman&mdash;A Burning
Shame&mdash;Magnificent
Impudence&mdash;Paunch&mdash;Voltaire&mdash;Lump of Sugar.</p>
<p>Occasionally I called on Francis Ardry.&nbsp; This young
gentleman resided in handsome apartments in the neighbourhood of
a fashionable square, kept a livery servant, and, upon the whole,
lived in very good style.&nbsp; Going to see him one day, between
one and two, I was informed by the servant that his master was
engaged for the moment, but that, if I pleased to wait a few
minutes, I should find him at liberty.&nbsp; Having told the man
that I had no objection, he conducted me into a small apartment
which served as antechamber to a drawing-room; the door of this
last being half open, I could see Francis Ardry at the farther
end, speechifying and gesticulating in a very impressive
manner.&nbsp; The servant, in some confusion, was hastening to
close the door; but, ere he could effect his purpose, Francis
Ardry, who had caught a glimpse of me, exclaimed, &ldquo;Come
in&mdash;come in by all means;&rdquo; and then proceeded, as
before, speechifying and gesticulating.&nbsp; Filled with some
surprise, I obeyed his summons.</p>
<p><!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>On entering the room I perceived another individual, to
whom Francis Ardry appeared to be addressing himself; this other
was a short spare man of about sixty; his hair was of badger
grey, and his face was covered with wrinkles&mdash;without
vouchsafing me a look, he kept his eye, which was black and
lustrous, fixed full on Francis Ardry, as if paying the deepest
attention to his discourse.&nbsp; All of a sudden, however, he
cried with a sharp, cracked voice, &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,
sir; that won&rsquo;t do&mdash;more vehemence&mdash;your argument
is at present particularly weak; therefore, more
vehemence&mdash;you must confuse them, stun them, stultify them,
sir;&rdquo; and, at each of these injunctions, he struck the back
of his right hand sharply against the palm of the left.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good, sir&mdash;good!&rdquo; he occasionally uttered, in
the same sharp, cracked tone, as the voice of Francis Ardry
became more and more vehement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Infinitely
good!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as Francis Ardry raised his voice to
the highest pitch; &ldquo;and now, sir, abate; let the tempest of
vehemence decline&mdash;gradually, sir; not too fast.&nbsp; Good,
sir&mdash;very good!&rdquo; as the voice of Francis Ardry
declined gradually in vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now a little
pathos, sir&mdash;try them with a little pathos.&nbsp; That
won&rsquo;t do, sir&mdash;that won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo;&mdash;as
Francis Ardry made an attempt to become
pathetic,&mdash;&ldquo;that will never pass for pathos&mdash;with
tones and gesture of that description you will never redress the
wrongs of your country.&nbsp; Now, sir, observe my gestures, and
pay attention to the tone of my voice, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, making use of nearly the same terms which Francis
Ardry had employed, the individual in black uttered several
sentences in tones and with <!-- page 358--><a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>gestures
which were intended to express a considerable degree of pathos,
though it is possible that some people would have thought both
the one and the other highly ludicrous.&nbsp; After a pause,
Francis Ardry recommenced imitating the tones and the gesture of
his monitor in the most admirable manner.&nbsp; Before he had
proceeded far, however, he burst into a fit of laughter, in which
I should, perhaps, have joined, provided it were ever my wont to
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said the other,
good-humouredly, &ldquo;you are laughing at me.&nbsp; Well, well,
I merely wished to give you a hint; but you saw very well what I
meant; upon the whole I think you improve.&nbsp; But I must now
go, having two other pupils to visit before four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then taking from the table a kind of three-cornered hat, and a
cane headed with amber, he shook Francis Ardry by the hand; and,
after glancing at me for a moment, made me a half bow, attended
with a strange grimace, and departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that gentleman?&rdquo; said I to Francis Ardry,
as soon as we were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is ---,&rdquo; said Frank, smiling, &ldquo;the
gentleman who gives me lessons in elocution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what need have you of elocution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I merely obey the commands of my guardians,&rdquo;
said Francis, &ldquo;who insist that I should, with the
assistance of ---, qualify myself for Parliament; for which they
do me the honour to suppose that I have some natural
talent.&nbsp; I dare not disobey them; for, at the present
moment, I have particular reasons for wishing to keep on good
terms with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are a Roman Catholic;
<!-- page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>and I thought that persons of your religion were
excluded from Parliament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, upon that very thing the whole matter hinges;
people of our religion are determined to be no longer excluded
from Parliament, but to have a share in the government of the
nation.&nbsp; Not that I care anything about the matter; I merely
obey the will of my guardians; my thoughts are fixed on something
better than politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;dog-fighting&mdash;well, I can easily conceive that to
some minds dog-fighting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of dog-fighting,&rdquo; said Francis
Ardry, interrupting me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not thinking of dog-fighting!&rdquo; I ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry; &ldquo;something higher
and much more rational than dog-fighting at present occupies my
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I thought I had heard
you say, that there was nothing like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; said Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog-fighting, to be sure,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry; &ldquo;who but the
gross and unrefined care anything for dog-fighting?&nbsp; That
which at present engages my waking and sleeping thoughts is
love&mdash;divine love&mdash;there is nothing like
<i>that</i>.&nbsp; Listen to me, I have a secret to confide to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Francis Ardry proceeded to make me his
confidant.&nbsp; It appeared that he had had the good fortune to
make the acquaintance of the most delightful young Frenchwoman
imaginable, Annette La Noire by name, who had just arrived from
her native country with the intention of obtaining the situation
of governess in some English family; a <!-- page 360--><a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>position
which, on account of her many accomplishments, she was eminently
qualified to fill.&nbsp; Francis Ardry had, however, persuaded
her to relinquish her intention for the present, on the ground
that, until she had become acclimated in England, her health
would probably suffer from the confinement inseparable from the
occupation in which she was desirous of engaging; he had,
moreover&mdash;for it appeared that she was the most frank and
confiding creature in the world&mdash;succeeded in persuading her
to permit him to hire for her a very handsome first floor in his
own neighbourhood, and to accept a few inconsiderable presents in
money and jewellery.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am looking out for a handsome
gig and horse,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, at the conclusion of
his narration; &ldquo;it were a burning shame that so divine a
creature should have to go about a place like London on foot, or
in a paltry hackney coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will not the pursuit of
politics prevent your devoting much time to this fair
lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will prevent me devoting all my time,&rdquo; said
Francis Ardry, &ldquo;as I gladly would; but what can I do?&nbsp;
My guardians wish me to qualify myself for a political orator,
and I dare not offend them by a refusal.&nbsp; If I offend my
guardians, I should find it impossible&mdash;unless I have
recourse to Jews and money-lenders&mdash;to support Annette;
present her with articles of dress and jewellery, and purchase a
horse and cabriolet worthy of conveying her angelic person
through the streets of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, in which Francis Ardry appeared lost in
thought, his mind being probably occupied with the subject of
Annette, I broke silence by observing, &ldquo;So your
fellow-religionists are really <!-- page 361--><a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>going to
make a serious attempt to procure their emancipation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, starting from his
reverie; &ldquo;everything has been arranged; even a leader has
been chosen, at least for us of Ireland, upon the whole the most
suitable man in the world for the occasion&mdash;a barrister of
considerable talent, mighty voice, and magnificent
impudence.&nbsp; With emancipation, liberty, and redress for the
wrongs of Ireland in his mouth, he is to force his way into the
British House of Commons, dragging myself and others behind
him&mdash;he will succeed, and when he is in he will cut a
figure; I have heard --- himself, who has heard --- him speak,
say that he will cut a figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is --- competent to judge?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who but he?&rdquo; said Francis Ardry; &ldquo;no one
questions his judgment concerning what relates to
elocution.&nbsp; His fame on that point is so well established,
that the greatest orators do not disdain occasionally to consult
him; C--- himself, as I have been told, when anxious to produce
any particular effect in the House, is in the habit of calling in
--- for a consultation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to matter, or manner?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefly the latter,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry,
&ldquo;though he is competent to give advice as to both, for he
has been an orator in his day, and a leader of the people; though
he confessed to me that he was not exactly qualified to play the
latter part&mdash;&lsquo;I want paunch,&rsquo; said
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not always indispensable,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;there is an orator in my town, a hunchback and watchmaker,
without it, who not only leads the people, <!-- page 362--><a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>but the
mayor too; perhaps he has a succedaneum in his hunch: but, tell
me, is the leader of your movement in possession of that which
--- wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more deficient in it than in brass,&rdquo; said
Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whatever his qualifications
may be, I wish him success in the cause which he has taken
up&mdash;I love religious liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall succeed,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry;
&ldquo;John Bull upon the whole is rather indifferent on the
subject, and then we are sure to be backed by the Radical party,
who, to gratify their political prejudices, would join with Satan
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;connected
with this matter which surprises me&mdash;your own
luke-warmness.&nbsp; Yes, making every allowance for your natural
predilection for dog-fighting, and your present enamoured state
of mind, your apathy at the commencement of such a movement is to
me unaccountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not have cause to complain of my
indifference,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;provided I thought my
country would be benefited by this movement; but I happen to know
the origin of it.&nbsp; The priests are the originators,
&lsquo;and what country was ever benefited by a movement which
owed its origin to them?&rsquo; so says Voltaire, a page of whom
I occasionally read.&nbsp; By the present move they hope to
increase their influence, and to further certain designs which
they entertain both with regard to this country and
Ireland.&nbsp; I do not speak rashly or unadvisedly.&nbsp; A
strange fellow&mdash;a half Italian, half English
priest&mdash;who was recommended to me by my guardians, partly as
a spiritual, partly as a <!-- page 363--><a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>temporal
guide, has let me into a secret or two; he is fond of a glass of
gin and water&mdash;and over a glass of gin and water cold, with
a lump of sugar in it, he has been more communicative, perhaps,
than was altogether prudent.&nbsp; Were I my own master, I would
kick him, politics, and religious movements, to a considerable
distance.&nbsp; And now, if you are going away, do so quickly; I
have an appointment with Annette, and must make myself fit to
appear before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Progress&mdash;Glorious John&mdash;Utterly
Unintelligible&mdash;What a Difference!</p>
<p>By the month of October I had, in spite of all difficulties
and obstacles, accomplished about two-thirds of the principal
task which I had undertaken, the compiling of the Newgate Lives;
I had also made some progress in translating the
publisher&rsquo;s philosophy into German.&nbsp; But about this
time I began to see very clearly that it was impossible that our
connection should prove of long duration; yet, in the event of my
leaving the big man, what other resource had I&mdash;another
publisher?&nbsp; But what had I to offer?&nbsp; There were my
ballads, my Ab Gwilym, but then I thought of Taggart and his
snuff, his pinch of snuff.&nbsp; However, I determined to see
what could be done, so I took my ballads under my arm, and went
to various publishers; some took snuff, others did not, but none
took my ballads or Ab Gwilym; they would not even look at
them.&nbsp; One asked me if I had anything else&mdash;he was a
snuff-taker&mdash;I said yes; and going home, returned with my
translation of the German novel, to which I have before
alluded.&nbsp; After keeping it for a fortnight, he returned it
to me on my visiting him, and, taking a pinch of snuff, told me
it would <!-- page 365--><a name="page365"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 365</span>not do.&nbsp; There were marks of
snuff on the outside of the manuscript, which was a roll of paper
bound with red tape, but there were no marks of snuff on the
interior of the manuscript, from which I concluded that he had
never opened it.</p>
<p>I had often heard of one Glorious John, <a
name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a> who lived at the western end of the
town; on consulting Taggart, he told me that it was possible that
Glorious John would publish my ballads and Ab Gwilym, that is,
said he, taking a pinch of snuff, provided you can see him; so I
went to the house where Glorious John resided, and a glorious
house it was, but I could not see Glorious John&mdash;I called a
dozen times, but I never could see Glorious John.&nbsp; Twenty
years after, by the greatest chance in the world, I saw Glorious
John, and sure enough Glorious John published my books, but they
were different books from the first; I never offered my ballads
or Ab Gwilym to Glorious John.&nbsp; Glorious John was no
snuff-taker.&nbsp; He asked me to dinner, and treated me with
superb Rhenish wine.&nbsp; Glorious John is now gone to his rest,
but I&mdash;what was I going to say?&mdash;the world will never
forget Glorious John.</p>
<p>So I returned to my last resource for the time then
being&mdash;to the publisher, persevering doggedly in my
labour.&nbsp; One day, on visiting the publisher, I found him
stamping with fury upon certain fragments of paper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you know nothing of German; I
have shown your translation of the first chapter of my Philosophy
to several Germans: it is utterly unintelligible to
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did they see the Philosophy?&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; <!-- page 366--><a name="page366"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 366</span>&ldquo;They did, sir, but they did
not profess to understand English.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No more do
I,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;if that Philosophy be
English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher was furious&mdash;I was silent.&nbsp; For want
of a pinch of snuff, I had recourse to something which is no bad
substitute for a pinch of snuff, to those who can&rsquo;t take
it, silent contempt; at first it made the publisher more furious,
as perhaps a pinch of snuff would; it, however, eventually calmed
him, and he ordered me back to my occupations, in other words,
the compilation.&nbsp; To be brief, the compilation was
completed, I got paid in the usual manner, and forthwith left
him.</p>
<p>He was a clever man, but what a difference in clever men!</p>
<h2><!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span

<p>The Old Spot&mdash;A Long History&mdash;Thou Shalt Not
Steal&mdash;No Harm&mdash;Education&mdash;Necessity&mdash;Foam on
Your Lip&mdash;Apples and Pears&mdash;What Will You
Read?&mdash;Metaphor&mdash;The Fur Cap&mdash;I Don&rsquo;t Know
Him.</p>
<p>It was past mid-winter, and I sat on London Bridge, in company
with the old apple-woman: she had just returned to the other side
of the bridge, to her place in the booth where I had originally
found her.&nbsp; This she had done after frequent conversations
with me; &ldquo;She liked the old place best,&rdquo; she said,
which she would never have left but for the terror which she
experienced when the boys ran away with her book.&nbsp; So I sat
with her at the old spot, one afternoon past midwinter, reading
the book, of which I had by this time come to the last
pages.&nbsp; I had observed that the old woman for some time past
had shown much less anxiety about the book than she had been in
the habit of doing.&nbsp; I was, however, not quite prepared for
her offering to make me a present of it, which she did that
afternoon; when, having finished it, I returned it to her, with
many thanks for the pleasure and instruction I had derived from
its perusal.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may keep it, dear,&rdquo; said the
old woman, with a sigh; &ldquo;you may carry it to your lodging,
and keep it for your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>Looking at the old woman with surprise, I exclaimed,
&ldquo;Is it possible that you are willing to part with the book
which has been your source of comfort so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the old woman entered into a long history, from
which I gathered that the book had become distasteful to her; she
hardly ever opened it of late, she said, or if she did, it was
only to shut it again; also, that other things which she had been
fond of, though of a widely different kind, were now distasteful
to her.&nbsp; Porter and beef-steaks were no longer grateful to
her palate, her present diet chiefly consisting of tea, and bread
and butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have been ill, and when
people are ill, they seldom like the things which give them
pleasure when they are in health.&rdquo;&nbsp; I learned,
moreover, that she slept little at night, and had all kinds of
strange thoughts; that as she lay awake many things connected
with her youth, which she had quite forgotten, came into her
mind.&nbsp; There were certain words that came into her mind the
night before the last, which were continually humming in her
ears: I found that the words were, &ldquo;Thou shalt not
steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On inquiring where she had first heard these words, I learned
that she had read them at school, in a book called the primer; to
this school she had been sent by her mother, who was a poor
widow, and followed the trade of apple-selling in the very spot
where her daughter followed it now.&nbsp; It seems that the
mother was a very good kind of woman, but quite ignorant of
letters, the benefit of which she was willing to procure for her
child; and at the school the daughter learned to read, and <!--
page 369--><a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>subsequently experienced the pleasure and benefit of
letters, in being able to read the book which she found in an
obscure closet of her mother&rsquo;s house, and which had been
her principal companion and comfort for many years of her
life.</p>
<p>But, as I have said before, she was now dissatisfied with the
book, and with most other things in which she had taken pleasure;
she dwelt much on the words, &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal;&rdquo;
she had never stolen things herself, but then she had bought
things which other people had stolen, and which she knew had been
stolen; and her dear son had been a thief, which he perhaps would
not have been but for the example which she set him in buying
things from characters, as she called them, who associated with
her.</p>
<p>On inquiring how she had become acquainted with these
characters, I learned that times had gone hard with her; that she
had married, but her husband had died after a long sickness,
which had reduced them to great distress; that her fruit trade
was not a profitable one, and that she had bought and sold things
which had been stolen to support herself and her son.&nbsp; That
for a long time she supposed there was no harm in doing so, as
her book was full of entertaining tales of stealing; but she now
thought that the book was a bad book, and that learning to read
was a bad thing; her mother had never been able to read, but had
died in peace, though poor.</p>
<p>So here was a woman who attributed the vices and follies of
her life to being able to read; her mother, she said, who could
not read, lived respectably, and died in peace; and what was the
essential difference between the mother and daughter, save <!--
page 370--><a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>that the latter could read?&nbsp; But for her
literature she might in all probability have lived respectably
and honestly, like her mother, and might eventually have died in
peace, which at present she could scarcely hope to do.&nbsp;
Education had failed to produce any good in this poor woman; on
the contrary, there could be little doubt that she had been
injured by it.&nbsp; Then was education a bad thing?&nbsp;
Rousseau was of opinion that it was; but Rousseau was a
Frenchman, at least wrote in French, and I cared not the snap of
my fingers for Rousseau.&nbsp; But education has certainly been
of benefit in some instances; well, what did that prove, but that
partiality existed in the management of the affairs of the
world&mdash;if education was a benefit to some, why was it not a
benefit to others?&nbsp; Could some avoid abusing it, any more
than others could avoid turning it to a profitable account?&nbsp;
I did not see how they could; this poor simple woman found a book
in her mother&rsquo;s closet; a book, which was a capital book
for those who could turn it to the account for which it was
intended; a book, from the perusal of which I felt myself wiser
and better, but which was by no means suited to the intellect of
this poor simple woman, who thought that it was written in praise
of thieving; yet she found it, she read it, and&mdash;and&mdash;I
felt myself getting into a maze.&nbsp; What is right, thought I?
what is wrong?&nbsp; Do I exist?&nbsp; Does the world exist? if
it does, every action is bound up with necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity!&rdquo; I exclaimed, and cracked my finger
joints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is a bad thing,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a bad thing?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to be poor, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>&ldquo;You talk like a fool,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;riches and poverty are only different forms of
necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not call me a fool, dear; you should not
call your own mother a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not my mother,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your mother, dear?&mdash;no, no more I am; but your
calling me fool put me in mind of my dear son, who often used to
call me fool&mdash;and you just now looked as he sometimes did,
with a blob of foam on your lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, I don&rsquo;t know that you are not my
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you, dear?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad of it; I
wish you would make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I make it out? who can speak from his own
knowledge as to the circumstances of his birth?&nbsp; Besides,
before attempting to establish our relationship, it would be
necessary to prove that such people exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What people, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, child, you are mad; that book has made you
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the book is
an excellent one, that is, provided it exists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it did not,&rdquo; said the old woman;
&ldquo;but it shan&rsquo;t long; I&rsquo;ll burn it, or fling it
into the river&mdash;the voices at night tell me to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the voices,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that they talk
nonsense; the book, if it exists, is a good book, it contains a
deep moral; have you read it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the funny parts, dear; all about taking things, and
the manner it was done; as for the rest, I could not exactly make
it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>&ldquo;Then the book is not to blame; I repeat that the
book is a good book, and contains deep morality, always supposing
that there is such a thing as morality, which is the same thing
as supposing that there is anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything at all!&nbsp; Why, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we here
on this bridge, in my booth, with my stall and
my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apples and pears, baked hot, you would say&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know; all is a mystery, a deep question.&nbsp; It is
a question, and probably always will be, whether there is a
world, and consequently apples and pears; and, provided there be
a world, whether that world be like an apple or a
pear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t; we will suppose that we all
exist&mdash;world, ourselves, apples, and pears: so you wish to
get rid of the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I wish you would take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read it, and have no farther use for it; I do
not need books: in a little time, perhaps, I shall not have a
place wherein to deposit myself, far less books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will fling it into the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that; here, give it me.&nbsp; Now, what
shall I do with it? you were so fond of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you pass your time; what will you
read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had never learned to read, or, if I had, that
I had only read the books I saw at school: the primer or the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they called it the Bible: all about God, and
Job, and Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
373</span>&ldquo;You have read it; is it a nice book&mdash;all
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to say; but if
the world be true, and not all a lie, a fiction, I don&rsquo;t
see why the Bible, as they call it, should not be true.&nbsp; By
the bye, what do you call Bible in your tongue, or, indeed, book
of any kind? as Bible merely means a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I call the Bible in my language,
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the language of those who bring you
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language of those who <i>did</i>, dear; they bring
them now no longer.&nbsp; They call me fool, as you did, dear,
just now; they call kissing the Bible, which means taking a false
oath, smacking calfskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s metaphor,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;English,
but metaphorical; what an odd language!&nbsp; So you would like
to have a Bible,&mdash;shall I buy you one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am poor, dear&mdash;no money since I left off the
other trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll buy you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, no; you are poor, and may soon want the
money; but if you can take me one conveniently on the sly, you
know&mdash;I think you may, for, as it is a good book, I suppose
there can be no harm in taking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will never do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;more
especially as I should be sure to be caught, not having made
taking of things my trade; but I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;try and exchange this book of yours for a
Bible; who knows for what great things this same book of yours
may serve?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>&ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;do
as you please; I should like to see the&mdash;what do you call
it?&mdash;Bible, and to read it, as you seem to think it
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;seem; that is the way to
express yourself in this maze of doubt&mdash;I seem to
think&mdash;these apples and pears seem to be&mdash;and here
seems to be a gentleman who wants to purchase either one or the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A person had stopped before the apple-woman&rsquo;s stall, and
was glancing now at the fruit, now at the old woman and myself;
he wore a blue mantle, and had a kind of fur cap on his head; he
was somewhat above the middle stature; his features were keen,
but rather hard; there was a slight obliquity in his
vision.&nbsp; Selecting a small apple, he gave the old woman a
penny; then, after looking at me scrutinisingly for a moment, he
moved from the booth in the direction of Southwark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who that man is?&rdquo; said I to the old
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;except that he is one of my
best customers: he frequently stops, takes an apple, and gives me
a penny; his is the only piece of money I have taken this blessed
day.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know him, but he has once or twice sat
down in the booth with two strange-looking men&mdash;Mulattos, or
Lascars, I think they call them.&rdquo;</p>

Firm&mdash;Bibles&mdash;Countenance of a Lion&mdash;Clap of
Thunder&mdash;A Truce with This&mdash;I Have Lost
It&mdash;Clearly a Right&mdash;Goddess of the Mint.</p>
<p>In pursuance of my promise to the old woman, I set about
procuring her a Bible with all convenient speed, placing the book
which she had entrusted to me for the purpose of exchange in my
pocket.&nbsp; I went to several shops, and asked if Bibles were
to be had: I found that there were plenty.&nbsp; When, however, I
informed the people that I came to barter, they looked blank, and
declined treating with me; saying that they did not do business
in that way.&nbsp; At last I went into a shop over the window of
which I saw written, &ldquo;Books bought and exchanged:&rdquo;
there was a smartish young fellow in the shop, with black hair
and whiskers.&nbsp; &ldquo;You exchange?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sometimes, but we prefer
selling; what book do you want?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
Bible,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a great demand for Bibles just now; all
kinds of people are become very pious of late,&rdquo; he added,
grinning at me; &ldquo;I am afraid I can&rsquo;t do business with
you, more especially as the master is not at home.&nbsp; What
book have you brought?&rdquo;&nbsp; Taking the book out <!-- page
376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>of
my pocket, I placed it on the counter: the young fellow opened
the book, and inspecting the title-page, burst into a loud
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you laugh for?&rdquo; said I,
angrily, and half clenching my fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Laugh!&rdquo;
said the young fellow; &ldquo;laugh! who could help
laughing?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I could,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
see nothing to laugh at; I want to exchange this book for a
Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do?&rdquo; said the young fellow;
&ldquo;well, I dare say there are plenty who would be willing to
exchange, that is, if they dared.&nbsp; I wish master were at
home; but that would never do, either.&nbsp; Master&rsquo;s a
family man, the Bibles are not mine, and master being a family
man, is sharp, and knows all his stock; I&rsquo;d buy it of you,
but, to tell you the truth, I am quite empty here,&rdquo; said
he, pointing to his pocket, &ldquo;so I am afraid we can&rsquo;t
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, looking anxiously at the young man, &ldquo;What am
I to do?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I really want a Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you buy one?&rdquo; said the young man;
&ldquo;have you no money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have some, but I am merely
the agent of another; I came to exchange, not to buy; what am I
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the young man,
thoughtfully laying down the book on the counter; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what you can do; I think you will find some
difficulty in this bartering job, the trade are rather
precise.&rdquo;&nbsp; All at once he laughed louder than before;
suddenly stopping, however, he put on a very grave look.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there is a firm
established in this neighbourhood which scarcely sells any books
but Bibles; they are very rich, and pride themselves <!-- page
377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>on
selling their books at the lowest possible price; apply to them,
who knows but what they will exchange with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I demanded with some eagerness of the young man the
direction to the place where he thought it possible that I might
effect the exchange&mdash;which direction the young fellow
cheerfully gave me, and, as I turned away, had the civility to
wish me success.</p>
<p>I had no difficulty in finding the house to which the young
fellow directed me; it was a very large house, situated in a
square; and upon the side of the house was written in large
letters, &ldquo;Bibles, and other religious books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the door of the house were two or three tumbrils, in the
act of being loaded with chests, very much resembling tea-chests;
one of the chests falling down, burst, and out flew, not tea, but
various books, in a neat, small size, and in neat leather covers;
Bibles, said I,&mdash;Bibles, doubtless.&nbsp; I was not quite
right, nor quite wrong; picking up one of the books, I looked at
it for a moment, and found it to be the New Testament.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, young lad,&rdquo; said a man who stood by, in the
dress of a porter, &ldquo;put that book down, it is none of
yours; if you want a book, go in and deal for one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deal, thought I, deal,&mdash;the man seems to know what I am
coming about,&mdash;and going in, I presently found myself in a
very large room.&nbsp; Behind a counter two men stood with their
backs to a splendid fire, warming themselves, for the weather was
cold.</p>
<p>Of these men one was dressed in brown, and the other was
dressed in black; both were tall men&mdash;he who was dressed in
brown was thin, and had a <!-- page 378--><a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>particularly ill-natured countenance; the man dressed
in black was bulky, his features were noble, but they were those
of a lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your business, young man?&rdquo; said the
precise personage, as I stood staring at him and his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a Bible,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price, what size?&rdquo; said the precise-looking
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to size,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should like to have
a large one&mdash;that is, if you can afford me one&mdash;I do
not come to buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, friend,&rdquo; said the precise-looking man,
&ldquo;if you come here expecting to have a Bible for nothing,
you are mistaken&mdash;we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would scorn to have a Bible for nothing,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;or anything else; I came not to beg, but to barter;
there is no shame in that, especially in a country like this,
where all folks barter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t barter,&rdquo; said the precise man,
&ldquo;at least Bibles; you had better depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, brother,&rdquo; said the man with the countenance
of a lion, &ldquo;let us ask a few questions; this may be a very
important case; perhaps the young man has had
convictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;I am convinced of
nothing, and with regard to the Bible&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; said the man with the lion countenance, and
there he stopped.&nbsp; But with that &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; the
walls of the house seemed to shake, the windows rattled, and the
porter whom I had seen in front of the house came running up the
steps, and looked into the apartment through the glass of the
door.&nbsp; <!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>There was silence for about a
minute&mdash;the same kind of silence which succeeds a clap of
thunder.</p>
<p>At last the man with the lion countenance, who had kept his
eyes fixed upon me, said calmly, &ldquo;Were you about to say
that you don&rsquo;t believe in the Bible, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than in anything else,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;you were talking of convictions&mdash;I have no
convictions.&nbsp; It is not easy to believe in the Bible till
one is convinced that there is a Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be insane,&rdquo; said the prim-looking
man; &ldquo;we had better order the porter to turn him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am by no means certain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
the porter could turn me out; always provided there is a porter,
and this system of ours be not a lie, and a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the lion-looking man, impatiently,
&ldquo;a truce with this nonsense.&nbsp; If the porter cannot
turn you out, perhaps some other person can; but to the
point&mdash;you want a Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but not for myself; I was
sent by another person to offer something in exchange for
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is that person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor old woman, who has had what you call
convictions,&mdash;heard voices, or thought she heard
them&mdash;I forgot to ask her whether they were loud
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she sent to offer in exchange?&rdquo; said the
man, without taking any notice of the concluding part of my
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A book,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>&ldquo;Nay, brother,&rdquo; said the precise man,
&ldquo;this will never do; if we once adopt the system of barter,
we shall have all the holders of useless rubbish in the town
applying to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see what he has brought,&rdquo; said the
other; &ldquo;perhaps Baxter, or Jewell&rsquo;s Apology, either
of which would make a valuable addition to our collection.&nbsp;
Well, young man, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood like one petrified; I had put my hand into my
pocket&mdash;the book was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; repeated the man with
the lion countenance, in a voice very much resembling
thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it not&mdash;I have lost it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty story, truly,&rdquo; said the precise-looking
man; &ldquo;lost it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better retire,&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I appear before the party who entrusted me
with the book?&nbsp; She will certainly think that I have
purloined it, notwithstanding all I can say; nor, indeed, can I
blame her,&mdash;appearances are certainly against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are so&mdash;you had better retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I moved towards the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay, young man, one
word more; there is only one way of proceeding which would induce
me to believe that you are sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said I, stopping and looking at
him anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The purchase of a Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purchase!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;purchase!&nbsp; I came
not to purchase, but to barter; such was my instruction, and how
can I barter if I have lost the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other made no answer, and turning away I <!-- page
381--><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
381</span>made for the door; all of a sudden I started, and
turning round, &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it has just
come into my head, that if the book was lost by my negligence, as
it must have been, I have clearly a right to make it
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;I have clearly a right
to make it good; how glad I am! see the effect of a little
reflection.&nbsp; I will purchase a Bible instantly, that is, if
I have not lost . . . &rdquo; and with considerable agitation I
felt in my pocket.</p>
<p>The prim-looking man smiled: &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that he has lost his money as well as book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have not;&rdquo; and
pulling out my hand I displayed no less a sum than three
half-crowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O noble goddess of the Mint!&rdquo; as Dame Charlotta
Nordenflycht, the Swede, said a hundred and fifty years ago,
&ldquo;great is thy power; how energetically the possession of
thee speaks in favour of man&rsquo;s character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only half a crown for this Bible?&rdquo; said I,
putting down the money; &ldquo;it is worth three;&rdquo; and
bowing to the man of the noble features, I departed with my
purchase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer customer,&rdquo; said the prim-looking man, as I
was about to close the door&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, I scarcely know what to say,&rdquo;
said he of the countenance of a lion.</p>

<p>The Pickpocket&mdash;Strange Rencounter&mdash;Drag Him
Along&mdash;A Great Service&mdash;Things of
Importance&mdash;Philological Matters&mdash;Mother of
Languages&mdash;Zhats!</p>
<p>A few days after the occurrence of what is recorded in the
last chapter, as I was wandering in the City, chance directed my
footsteps to an alley leading from one narrow street to another
in the neighbourhood of Cheapside.&nbsp; Just before I reached
the mouth of the alley, a man in a great-coat, closely followed
by another, passed it; and, at the moment in which they were
passing, I observed the man behind snatch something from the
pocket of the other; whereupon, darting into the street, I seized
the hindermost man by the collar, crying at the same time to the
other, &ldquo;My good friend, this person has just picked your
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The individual whom I addressed, turning round with a start,
glanced at me, and then at the person whom I held.&nbsp; London
is the place for strange rencounters.&nbsp; It appeared to me
that I recognised both individuals&mdash;the man whose pocket had
been picked and the other; the latter now began to struggle
violently; &ldquo;I have picked no one&rsquo;s pocket,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rascal,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you
have got my pocket-book in your bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I
have not,&rdquo; said the other; and, struggling <!-- page
383--><a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>more violently than before, the pocket-book dropped
from his bosom upon the ground.</p>
<p>The other was now about to lay hands upon the fellow, who was
still struggling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better take up your
book,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I can hold him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
followed my advice; and, taking up his pocket-book, surveyed my
prisoner with a ferocious look, occasionally glaring at me.&nbsp;
Yes, I had seen him before&mdash;it was the stranger whom I had
observed on London Bridge, by the stall of the old apple-woman,
with the cap and cloak; but, instead of these, he now wore a hat
and great-coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, at last,
&ldquo;what am I to do with this gentleman of ours?&rdquo;
nodding to the prisoner, who had now left off struggling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shall I let him go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;go!&nbsp; The
knave&mdash;the rascal; let him go, indeed!&nbsp; Not so, he
shall go before the Lord Mayor.&nbsp; Bring him along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let me go,&rdquo; said the other: &ldquo;let me go;
this is the first offence, I assure ye&mdash;the first time I
ever thought to do anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or I shall be
angry with you.&nbsp; If I am not very much mistaken, you once
attempted to cheat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you before in all my life,&rdquo; said the
fellow, though his countenance seemed to belie his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you are the man
who attempted to cheat me of one-and-ninepence in the coach-yard,
on the first morning of my arrival in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;a
confirmed thief;&rdquo; and here his tones became peculiarly
sharp; &ldquo;I would fain see him hanged&mdash;crucified.&nbsp;
Drag him along.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 384--><a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>&ldquo;I am no constable,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you
have got your pocket-book,&mdash;I would rather you would bid me
let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bid you let him go!&rdquo; said the other almost
furiously; &ldquo;I command&mdash;stay, what was I going to
say?&nbsp; I was forgetting myself,&rdquo; he observed more
gently; &ldquo;but he stole my pocket-book;&mdash;if you did but
know what it contained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if it contains anything
valuable, be the more thankful that you have recovered it; as for
the man, I will help you to take him where you please; but I wish
you would let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger hesitated, and there was an extraordinary play of
emotion in his features: he looked ferociously at the pickpocket,
and, more than once, somewhat suspiciously at myself; at last his
countenance cleared, and, with a good grace, he said,
&ldquo;Well, you have done me a great service, and you have my
consent to let him go; but the rascal shall not escape with
impunity,&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, as I let the man go, and
starting forward, before the fellow could escape, he struck him a
violent blow on the face.&nbsp; The man staggered, and had nearly
fallen; recovering himself, however, he said, &ldquo;I tell you
what, my fellow, if I ever meet you in this street in a dark
night, and I have a knife about me, it shall be the worse for
you; as for you, young man,&rdquo; said he to me; but, observing
that the other was making towards him, he left whatever he was
about to say unfinished, and, taking to his heels, was out of
sight in a moment.</p>
<p>The stranger and myself walked in the direction of Cheapside,
the way in which he had been originally proceeding; he was silent
for a few <!-- page 385--><a name="page385"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 385</span>moments, at length he said,
&ldquo;You have really done me a great service, and I should be
ungrateful not to acknowledge it.&nbsp; I am a merchant; and a
merchant&rsquo;s pocket-book, as you perhaps know, contains many
things of importance; but, young man,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I think I have seen you before; I thought so at first, but
where I cannot exactly say: where was it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
mentioned London Bridge and the old apple-woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, and smiled, and there was something
peculiar in his smile, &ldquo;I remember now.&nbsp; Do you
frequently sit on London Bridge?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Occasionally,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that old woman is an
old friend of mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend?&rdquo; said the
stranger; &ldquo;I am glad of it, for I shall know where to find
you.&nbsp; At present I am going to &rsquo;Change; time, you
know, is precious to a merchant.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were by this
time close to Cheapside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I shall not forget this service.&nbsp; I trust we shall
soon meet again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then shook me by the hand and
went his way.</p>
<p>The next day, as I was seated beside the old woman in the
booth, the stranger again made his appearance, and, after a word
or two, sat down beside me; the old woman was sometimes reading
the Bible, which she had already had two or three days in her
possession, and sometimes discoursing with me.&nbsp; Our
discourse rolled chiefly on philological matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call bread in your language?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the language of those who bring me things to
buy, or who did; for, as I told you before, I shan&rsquo;t buy
any more; it&rsquo;s no language of mine, dear&mdash;they call
bread pannam in their language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pannam!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;pannam! evidently
connected with, if not derived from, the Latin panis; even as the
word tanner, which signifieth a sixpence, <!-- page 386--><a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>is
connected with, if not derived from, the Latin tener, which is
itself connected with, if not derived from, tawno or tawner,
which, in the language of Mr. Petulengro, signifieth a sucking
child. <a name="citation386"></a><a href="#footnote386"
class="citation">[386]</a>&nbsp; Let me see, what is the term for
bread in the language of Mr. Petulengro?&nbsp; Morro, or manro,
as I have sometimes heard it called; is there not some connection
between these words and panis?&nbsp; Yes, I think there is; and I
should not wonder if morro, manro, and panis were connected,
perhaps derived from the same root; but what is that root?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I wish I did; though, perhaps, I should
not be the happier.&nbsp; Morro&mdash;manro!&nbsp; I rather think
morro is the oldest form; it is easier to say morro than
manro.&nbsp; Morro!&nbsp; Irish, aran; Welsh, bara; English,
bread.&nbsp; I can see a resemblance between all the words, and
pannam too; and I rather think that the Petulengrian word is the
elder.&nbsp; How odd it would be if the language of Mr.
Petulengro should eventually turn out to be the mother of all the
languages in the world; yet it is certain that there are some
languages in which the terms for bread have no connection with
the word used by Mr. Petulengro, notwithstanding that those
languages, in many other points, exhibit a close affinity to the
language of the horse-shoe master: for example, bread, in Hebrew,
is Laham, which assuredly exhibits little similitude to the word
used by the aforesaid Petulengro.&nbsp; In Armenian it
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhats!&rdquo; said the stranger, starting up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the Patriarch and the Three Holy Churches, this is
wonderful!&nbsp; How came you to know aught of
Armenian?&rdquo;</p>

Money&mdash;What a Language&mdash;The Tide&mdash;Your
Foible&mdash;Learning of the Haiks&mdash;Old
Proverb&mdash;Pressing Invitation.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to reply to the interrogation of my
new-formed acquaintance, a man, with a dusky countenance,
probably one of the Lascars, or Mulattos, of whom the old woman
had spoken, came up and whispered to him, and with this man he
presently departed,&mdash;not, however, before he had told me the
place of his abode, and requested me to visit him.</p>
<p>After the lapse of a few days, I called at the house, which he
had indicated.&nbsp; It was situated in a dark and narrow street,
in the heart of the city, at no great distance from the
bank.&nbsp; I entered a counting-room, in which a solitary clerk,
with a foreign look, was writing.&nbsp; The stranger was not at
home; returning the next day, however, I met him at the door as
he was about to enter; he shook me warmly by the hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am glad to see you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;follow me; I
was just thinking of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He led me through the
counting-room, to an apartment up a flight of stairs; before
ascending, however, he looked into the book in which the <!--
page 388--><a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>foreign-visaged clerk was writing, and, seemingly not
satisfied with the manner in which he was executing his task, he
gave him two or three cuffs, telling him at the same time that he
deserved crucifixion.</p>
<p>The apartment above stairs, to which he led me, was large,
with three windows, which opened upon the street.&nbsp; The walls
were hung with wired cases, apparently containing books.&nbsp;
There was a table and two or three chairs; but the principal
article of furniture was a long sofa, extending, from the door by
which we entered, to the farther end of the apartment.&nbsp;
Seating himself upon the sofa, my new acquaintance motioned to me
to sit beside him, and then, looking me full in the face,
repeated his former inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the name of all that
is wonderful, how came you to know aught of my
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing wonderful in that,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;we are at the commencement of a philological age, every
one studies languages: that is, every one who is fit for nothing
else; philology being the last resource of dulness and ennui, I
have got a little in advance of the throng, by mastering the
Armenian alphabet; but I foresee the time when every
unmarriageable miss, and desperate blockhead, will likewise have
acquired the letters of Mesroub, and will know the term for
bread, in Armenian, and perhaps that for wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kini,&rdquo; said my companion; and that and the other
word put me in mind of the duties of hospitality.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you eat bread and drink wine with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; Whereupon my companion,
unlocking a closet, produced, on a silver <!-- page 389--><a
name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 389</span>salver, a
loaf of bread, with a silver-handled knife, and wine in a silver
flask, with cups of the same metal.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you like
my fare,&rdquo; said he, after we had both eaten and drunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your bread,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for it is
stale; I like not your wine; it is sweet, and I hate sweet
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wine of Cyprus,&rdquo; said my entertainer; and,
when I found that it was wine of Cyprus, I tasted it again, and
the second taste pleased me much better than the first,
notwithstanding that I still thought it somewhat sweet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said I, after a pause, looking at my companion,
&ldquo;you are an Armenian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an Armenian born in London,
but not less an Armenian on that account.&nbsp; My father was a
native of Ispahan, one of the celebrated Armenian colony which
was established there shortly after the time of the dreadful
hunger, which drove the children of Haik in swarms from their
original country, and scattered them over most parts of the
eastern and western world.&nbsp; In Ispahan he passed the greater
portion of his life, following mercantile pursuits with
considerable success.&nbsp; Certain enemies, however, having
accused him to the despot of the place, of using seditious
language, he was compelled to flee, leaving most of his property
behind.&nbsp; Travelling in the direction of the west, he came at
last to London, where he established himself, and where he
eventually died, leaving behind a large property and myself, his
only child, the fruit of a marriage with an Armenian English
woman, who did not survive my birth more than three
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Armenian then proceeded to tell me that he <!-- page
390--><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>had carried on the business of his father, which seemed
to embrace most matters, from buying silks of Lascars, to
speculating in the funds, and that he had considerably increased
the property which his father had left him.&nbsp; He candidly
confessed that he was wonderfully fond of gold, and said there
was nothing like it for giving a person respectability and
consideration in the world: to which assertion I made no answer,
being not exactly prepared to contradict it.</p>
<p>And, when he had related to me his history, he expressed a
desire to know something more of myself, whereupon I gave him the
outline of my history, concluding with saying, &ldquo;I am now a
poor author, or rather philologist, upon the streets of London,
possessed of many tongues, which I find of no use in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning without money is anything but
desirable,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;as it unfits a man
for humble occupations.&nbsp; It is true that it may occasionally
beget him friends; I confess to you that your understanding
something of my language weighs more with me than the service you
rendered me in rescuing my pocket-book the other day from the
claws of that scoundrel whom I yet hope to see hanged, if not
crucified, notwithstanding there were in that pocket-book papers
and documents of considerable value.&nbsp; Yes, that circumstance
makes my heart warm towards you, for I am proud of my
language&mdash;as I indeed well may be&mdash;what a language,
noble and energetic! quite original, differing from all others
both in words and structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;many languages
resemble the Armenian both in structure and words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 391--><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>&ldquo;For example?&rdquo; said the Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the
English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English?&rdquo; said the Armenian; &ldquo;show me
one word in which the English resembles the Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You walk on London Bridge,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you look over the balustrade the other
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you see rushing up through the arches
with noise and foam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; said the Armenian.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What was it?&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean the
<i>tide</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what has the tide to do with the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what is the
tide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ebb and flow of the sea,&rdquo; said the
Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea itself; what is the Haik word for
sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Armenian gave a strong gasp; then, nodding his head
thrice, &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the English
word tide is the Armenian for sea; and now I begin to perceive
that there are many English words which are Armenian; there is
--- and ---, and there again in French there is --- and ---
derived from the Armenian.&nbsp; How strange, how
singular!&mdash;I thank you.&nbsp; It is a proud thing to see
that the language of my race has had so much influence over the
languages of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw that all that related to his race was the weak point of
the Armenian.&nbsp; I did not flatter the <!-- page 392--><a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>Armenian
with respect to his race or language.&nbsp; &ldquo;An
inconsiderable people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;shrewd and
industrious, but still an inconsiderable people.&nbsp; A language
bold and expressive, and of some antiquity, derived, though
perhaps not immediately, from some much older tongue.&nbsp; I do
not think that the Armenian has had any influence over the
formation of the languages of the world.&nbsp; I am not much
indebted to the Armenian for the solution of any doubts; whereas
to the language of Mr. Petulengro&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard you mention that name before,&rdquo; said
the Armenian; &ldquo;who is Mr. Petulengro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I told the Armenian who Mr. Petulengro was.&nbsp; The
Armenian spoke contemptuously of Mr. Petulengro and his
race.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak contemptuously of Mr.
Petulengro,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;nor of anything belonging to
him.&nbsp; He is a dark mysterious personage; all connected with
him is a mystery, especially his language; but I believe that his
language is doomed to solve a great philological
problem&mdash;Mr. Petulengro&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear agitated,&rdquo; said the Armenian;
&ldquo;take another glass of wine; you possess a great deal of
philological knowledge, but it appears to me that the language of
this Petulengro is your foible: but let us change the subject; I
feel much interested in you, and would fain be of service to
you.&nbsp; Can you cast accounts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea that I could write books,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;but, as to keeping them . . . &rdquo; and here again I
shook my head.</p>
<p>The Armenian was silent some time; all at <!-- page 393--><a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>once,
glancing at one of the wire cases, with which, as I have already
said, the walls of the room were hung, he asked me if I was well
acquainted with the learning of the Haiks.&nbsp; &ldquo;The books
in these cases,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;contain the master-pieces
of Haik learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;all I know of the learning of
the Haiks is their translation of the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never read Z---?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have never read
Z---.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; said the Armenian; &ldquo;I think
I can employ you agreeably and profitably; I should like to see
Z--- in an English dress; you shall translate Z---.&nbsp; If you
can read the Scriptures in Armenian, you can translate
Z---.&nbsp; He is our Esop, the most acute and clever of all our
moral writers&mdash;his philosophy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have nothing to do with him,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said the Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an old proverb,&rdquo; said I,
&lsquo;&ldquo;that a burnt child avoids the fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
have burnt my hands sufficiently with attempting to translate
philosophy, to make me cautious of venturing upon it
again;&rdquo; and then I told the Armenian how I had been
persuaded by the publisher to translate his philosophy into
German, and what sorry thanks I had received; &ldquo;and who
knows,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but the attempt to translate
Armenian philosophy into English might be attended with yet more
disagreeable consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Armenian smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would find me very
different from the publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In many points I have no doubt I should,&rdquo; I
replied; &ldquo;but at the present moment I feel like a bird
which has escaped from a cage, and, <!-- page 394--><a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>though
hungry, feels no disposition to return.&nbsp; Of what nation is
the dark man below stairs, whom I saw writing at the
desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a Moldave,&rdquo; said the Armenian; &ldquo;the
dog [and here his eyes sparkled] deserves to be crucified; he is
continually making mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Armenian again renewed his proposition about Z---, which I
again refused, as I felt but little inclination to place myself
beneath the jurisdiction of a person who was in the habit of
cuffing those whom he employed, when they made mistakes.&nbsp; I
presently took my departure; not, however, before I had received
from the Armenian a pressing invitation to call upon him whenever
I should feel disposed.</p>

<p>What to Do&mdash;Strong Enough&mdash;Fame and
Profit&mdash;Alliterative Euphony&mdash;Excellent
Fellow&mdash;Listen to Me&mdash;A Plan&mdash;Bagnigge Wells.</p>
<p>Anxious thoughts frequently disturbed me at this time with
respect to what I was to do, and how support myself in the great
city.&nbsp; My future prospects were gloomy enough, and I looked
forward and feared; sometimes I felt half disposed to accept the
offer of the Armenian, and to commence forthwith, under his
superintendence, the translation of the Haik Esop; but the
remembrance of the cuffs which I had seen him bestow upon the
Moldavian, when glancing over his shoulder into the ledger or
whatever it was on which he was employed, immediately drove the
inclination from my mind.&nbsp; I could not support the idea of
the possibility of his staring over my shoulder upon my
translation of the Haik Esop, and, dissatisfied with my attempts,
treating me as he had treated the Moldavian clerk; placing myself
in a position which exposed me to such treatment, would indeed be
plunging into the fire after escaping from the frying-pan.&nbsp;
The publisher, insolent and overbearing as he was, whatever he
might have wished or thought, had never lifted his <!-- page
396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>hand against me, or told me that I merited
crucifixion.</p>
<p>What was I to do? turn porter?&nbsp; I was strong; but there
was something besides strength required to ply the trade of a
porter&mdash;a mind of a particularly phlegmatic temperament,
which I did not possess.&nbsp; What should I do?&mdash;enlist as
a soldier?&nbsp; I was tall enough; but something besides height
is required to make a man play with credit the part of soldier, I
mean a private one&mdash;a spirit, if spirit it can be called,
which will not only enable a man to submit with patience to
insolence and abuse, and even to cuffs and kicks, but
occasionally to the lash.&nbsp; I felt that I was not qualified
to be a soldier, at least a private one; far better be a drudge
to the most ferocious of publishers, editing Newgate Lives, and
writing in eighteenpenny Reviews&mdash;better to translate the
Haik Esop, under the superintendence of ten Armenians, than be a
private soldier in the English service; I did not decide
rashly&mdash;I knew something of soldiering.&nbsp; What should I
do?&nbsp; I thought that I would make a last and desperate
attempt to dispose of the ballads and of Ab Gwilym.</p>
<p>I had still an idea that, provided I could persuade any
spirited publisher to give these translations to the world, I
should acquire both considerable fame and profit; not, perhaps, a
world-embracing fame such as Byron&rsquo;s; but a fame not to be
sneered at, which would last me a considerable time, and would
keep my heart from breaking;&mdash;profit, not equal to that
which Scott had made by his wondrous novels, but which would
prevent me from starving, and enable me to achieve some other
literary enterprise.&nbsp; I read and re-read my ballads, and the
more I read them the more I was convinced that <!-- page 397--><a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>the public,
in the event of their being published, would freely purchase, and
hail them with the merited applause.&nbsp; Were not the deeds and
adventures wonderful and heart-stirring, from which it is true I
could claim no merit, being but the translator; but had I not
rendered them into English, with all their original fire?&nbsp;
Yes, I was confident I had; and I had no doubt that the public
would say so.&nbsp; And then, with respect to Ab Gwilym, had I
not done as much justice to him as to the Danish ballads; not
only rendering faithfully his thoughts, imagery, and phraseology,
but even preserving in my translation the alliterative euphony
which constitutes one of the most remarkable features of Welsh
prosody?&nbsp; Yes, I had accomplished all this; and I doubted
not that the public would receive my translations from Ab Gwilym
with quite as much eagerness as my version of the Danish
ballads.&nbsp; But I found the publishers as untractable as ever,
and to this day the public has never had an opportunity of doing
justice to the glowing fire of my ballad versification, <a
name="citation397"></a><a href="#footnote397"
class="citation">[397]</a> and the alliterative euphony of my
imitations of Ab Gwilym.</p>
<p>I had not seen Francis Ardry since the day I had seen him
taking lessons in elocution.&nbsp; One afternoon as I was seated
at my table, my head resting on my hands, he entered my
apartment; sitting down, he inquired of me why I had not been to
see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might ask the same question of you,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore have you not been to see <!--
page 398--><a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon Francis Ardry told me that
he had been much engaged in his oratorical exercises, also in
escorting the young Frenchwoman about to places of public
amusement; he then again questioned me as to the reason of my not
having been to see him.</p>
<p>I returned an evasive answer.&nbsp; The truth was, that for
some time past my appearance, owing to the state of my finances,
had been rather shabby; and I did not wish to expose a
fashionable young man like Francis Ardry, who lived in a
fashionable neighbourhood, to the imputation of having a shabby
acquaintance.&nbsp; I was aware that Francis Ardry was an
excellent fellow; but, on that very account, I felt, under
existing circumstances, a delicacy in visiting him.</p>
<p>It is very possible that he had an inkling of how matters
stood, as he presently began to talk of my affairs and
prospects.&nbsp; I told him of my late ill success with the
booksellers, and inveighed against their blindness to their own
interest in refusing to publish my translations.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
last that I addressed myself to,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;told me
not to trouble him again unless I could bring him a decent novel
or a tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and why did you not
carry him a decent novel or a tale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have neither,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and to
write them is, I believe, above my capacity.&nbsp; At present I
feel divested of all energy&mdash;heartless, and almost
hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, &ldquo;you
have overworked yourself, and, worst of all, to no purpose.&nbsp;
Take my advice; cast all care aside, and only think of diverting
yourself for a month at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 399--><a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>&ldquo;Divert myself,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and where
am I to find the means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that care on my shoulders,&rdquo; said Francis
Ardry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen to me&mdash;my uncles have been so
delighted with the favourable accounts which they have lately
received from T--- of my progress in oratory, that, in the warmth
of their hearts, they made me a present yesterday of two hundred
pounds.&nbsp; This is more money than I want, at least for the
present; do me the favour to take half of it as a loan&mdash;hear
me,&rdquo; said he, observing that I was about to interrupt him;
&ldquo;I have a plan in my head&mdash;one of the prettiest in the
world.&nbsp; The sister of my charmer is just arrived from
France; she cannot speak a word of English; and, as Annette and
myself are much engaged in our own matters, we cannot pay her the
attention which we should wish, and which she deserves, for she
is a truly fascinating creature, although somewhat differing from
my charmer, having blue eyes and flaxen hair; whilst Annette, on
the contrary . . . But I hope you will shortly see Annette.&nbsp;
Now, my plan is this&mdash;Take the money, dress yourself
fashionably, and conduct Annette&rsquo;s sister to Bagnigge
Wells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what should we do at Bagnigge Wells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; said Francis Ardry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I scarcely know anything of
dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s an excellent opportunity of improving
yourself.&nbsp; Like most Frenchwomen, she dances divinely;
however, if you object to Bagnigge Wells and dancing, go to

is, I dare say, well meant.&nbsp; If I am to escape from my cares

class="footnote">[169a]</a>&nbsp; In Vol. i. p. 320 of
<i>Etymologicon Universale</i> (3 vols., 1822-25), by the Rev.
Walter Whiter (1758-1832), from 1797 rector of Hardingham, near
Wymondham, occurs this suggestion: &ldquo;It will perhaps be
discovered by some future inquirer that from a horde of vagrant
<i>Gipseys</i> once issued that band of sturdy robbers, the
companions of Romulus and of Remus, who laid the foundations of
the <i>Eternal City</i> on the banks of the Tibur.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This sounds truly Borrovian; and scattered through the amazing
<i>Etymologicon</i> are twenty-six Romany words, very correctly
spelt, which I used to think Whiter must have learnt from George
Borrow.&nbsp; But there are words that Borrow does not seem to
have known&mdash;<i>poshe</i>, near; <i>kam</i>, sun; <i>ria</i>,
sir (vocative), and <i>petalles</i>, horse-shoe
(accusative).&nbsp; Whiter appears to have known Romany better
than Borrow.&nbsp; Borrow certainly meant to write a good deal
about Whiter, for in a letter to John Murray of 1st December 1842
he sketches <i>Lavengro</i>: &ldquo;Capital subject&mdash;early
life; studies and adventures; some account of my father, William
Taylor, Whiter, Big Ben, etc. etc.&rdquo; (Knapp, ii. 5).&nbsp;
But he barely mentions Whiter in chap. xxiv. of
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; In the <i>Gypsy Lore Journal</i> (i. 1888,
pp. 102-4) I had an article on Whiter.&nbsp; That on Whiter by
Mr. Courtney, in vol. lxi. of the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i> (1900), shows that he was writing on the Gypsy
language in 1800 and 1811.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
